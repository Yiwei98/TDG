Let's assume no pies have three or more of these ingredients.\n\nSince 27 pies have cayenne and 6 pies have salted soy nuts, there must be at least $27 + 6 - 36 = -3$ pies with both cayenne and salted soy nuts. Since this number is negative, we know that no pies have both cayenne and salted soy nuts.\n\nSince 24 pies have marshmallows and 6 pies have salted soy nuts, there must be at least $24 + 6 - 36 = -6$ pies with both marshmallows and salted soy nuts. Since this number is negative, we know that no pies have both marshmallows and salted soy nuts.\n\nSince 24 pies have marshmallows and 27 pies have cayenne, there must be at least $24 + 27 - 36 = 15$ pies with both marshmallows and cayenne.\n\nFinally, since 18 pies have chocolate and 27 pies have cayenne, there must be at least $18 + 27 - 36 = 9$ pies with both chocolate and cayenne.\n\nNow, we can count the number of pies with one or more of these ingredients:\n- 18 pies with chocolate (9 of which also have cayenne)\n- 24 pies with marshmallows (15 of which also have cayenne)\n- 27 pies with cayenne\n- 6 pies with salted soy nuts\n\nSubtracting the overlaps (9 pies with chocolate and cayenne, 15 pies with marshmallows and cayenne), we get a total of $18 + 24 + 27 + 6 - 9 - 15 = 51$ pies with one or more of these ingredients.\n\nHowever, we've counted the 36 pies in total, so there must be $51 - 36 = 15$ pies that we've counted twice. These are the pies with two of these ingredients (chocolate and cayenne, or marshmallows and cayenne).\n\nSo, the largest possible number of pies with none of these ingredients is $36 - (18 + 24 + 6 - 15) = \\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is 3."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Prealgebra"}
