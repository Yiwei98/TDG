{"question": "The landlord of an apartment building needs to purchase enough digits to label all of the apartments from 100 through 125 on the first floor and 200 through 225 on the second floor. The digits can only be purchased in a package that contains one of each digit 0 through 9. How many packages must the landlord purchase?", "answer": "Since 1 and 2 are used at least once in half of the apartments, and no other number is used this often, either 1 or 2 will be the most frequent digit used.\n\nNotice, though, that since all of the numbers of the form $\\star1\\star$ appear but only 6 of the numbers $\\star2\\star$ appear, 2 will be used less often than 1 and we should count the number of 1s to find the number of packages needed.\n\n100 through 125 requires 26 ones just for the hundreds place. 100 through 125 and 200 through 225 require the same number of ones for the tens and units places; that is, thirteen.\n\nSo, there are $26 + 2 \\cdot 13 = 52$ ones used. Therefore, the landlord must purchase $\\boxed{52}$ packages.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nWe first count the number of digits the landlord needs for each digit from 0 to 9.\nFor the first floor, the digit 1 appears 26 times (in the hundreds place for each apartment number), the digit 0 appears 3 times (in the tens place for 100, 110, and 120), and the digits 2 through 5 each appear 3 times (in the tens place for 102-105, 112-115, 122-125).\nFor the second floor, the digit 2 appears 26 times (in the hundreds place for each apartment number), the digit 0 appears 3 times (in the tens place for 200, 210, and 220), and the digits 2 through 5 each appear 3 times (in the tens place for 202-205, 212-215, 222-225).\n\nIn total, the landlord needs the following number of each digit:\n- 1: 26 times\n- 0: 6 times\n- 2: 32 times\n- 3: 6 times\n- 4: 6 times\n- 5: 6 times\n- 6: 0 times\n- 7: 0 times\n- 8: 0 times\n- 9: 0 times\n\nSince the landlord needs 32 of the digit 2, they must buy at least 4 packages (since each package contains only one digit 2). With 4 packages, they will have enough of every other digit as well. Therefore, the landlord must purchase $\\boxed{4}$ packages.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first count the number of each digit needed for the apartment numbers.\nFor the first floor, there are 26 apartments with a 1 as the first digit. For the second floor, there are 26 apartments with a 2 as the first digit. So, we need 26 ones and 26 twos.\nFor the last two digits, there are 26 apartments with each digit from 00 to 25. This means we need 2 of each digit from 0 to 5, and 1 of each digit from 6 to 9.\nIn total, we need 26 ones, 26 twos, 2 of each digit from 0 to 5, and 1 of each digit from 6 to 9.\nNow, let's see how many packages we need to buy. Since there is only one 1 and one 2 in each package, we need to buy at least 26 packages to have enough ones and twos.\nIn 26 packages, we have 26 of each digit from 0 to 9. We have enough of each digit from 6 to 9, as we only need one of them. We also have enough of each digit from 0 to 5, as we need 2 of them and 26 is more than enough.\nSo, the landlord must purchase $\\boxed{26}$ packages.", "Let's think step by step\nThe landlord needs to label 26 apartments on each floor, for a total of 52 apartments.\nEach apartment number has three digits, so the landlord needs to purchase a total of 52 * 3 = 156 digits.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each digit the landlord needs.\nFor the hundreds place, there are 26 ones and 26 twos, for a total of 52.\nFor the tens place, there are 13 zeros, 13 ones, and 26 twos, for a total of 52.\nFor the units place, there are 2 of each digit from 0 to 5, and 1 of each digit from 6 to 9, for a total of 20.\n\nSo, the landlord needs 52 ones, 52 twos, 13 zeros, 13 ones, 20 assorted digits (0-9).\nSince each package contains one of each digit, the landlord needs to purchase at least 52 packages to have enough ones and twos.\nIn those 52 packages, there will also be 52 zeros, which is more than enough for the 13 needed.\nThere will also be 52 of each digit from 3 to 9, which is more than enough for the 20 assorted digits needed for the units place.\n\nTherefore, the landlord must purchase a total of $\\boxed{52}$ packages.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first count the number of each digit needed.\nFor apartments 100 through 125, the digit 1 is used 26 times, the digits 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are used 6 times each, and the digits 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not used.\nFor apartments 200 through 225, the digit 2 is used 26 times, the digits 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 are used 6 times each, and the digits 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not used.\nIn total, we need 26 ones, 26 twos, 12 zeroes, 12 threes, 12 fours, and 12 fives.\nWe must buy at least 26/1 = 26 packages to have enough ones and at least 26/1 = 26 packages to have enough twos.\nBuying 26 packages gives us 26 of each digit, which is enough for all the other digits as well.\nTherefore, the landlord must purchase $\\boxed{26}$ packages.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first count the number of each digit needed for the apartments on the first floor.\nFor the hundreds digit, we need 26 of the digit 1.\nFor the tens digit, we need 10 of the digit 0, 10 of the digit 1, and 6 of the digit 2.\nFor the units digit, we need 3 each of the digits 0 through 9 (since each digit appears 3 times).\n\nNow, we count the number of each digit needed for the apartments on the second floor.\nFor the hundreds digit, we need 26 of the digit 2.\nFor the tens digit, we need 10 of the digit 0, 10 of the digit 1, and 6 of the digit 2.\nFor the units digit, we need 3 each of the digits 0 through 9 (since each digit appears 3 times).\n\nCombining the counts for both floors, we need:\n- 26 of the digit 1\n- 52 of the digit 2\n- 20 of the digit 0\n- 20 of the digit 1\n- 12 of the digit 2\n- 6 each of the digits 3 through 9\n\nSo, we need a total of 46 of the digit 1, 64 of the digit 2, 20 of the digit 0, and 6 each of the digits 3 through 9.\n\nWe must purchase at least 5 packages to have enough of the digit 1 (since 46/9 > 5), and at least 7 packages to have enough of the digit 2 (since 64/9 > 7). Since we need more packages for the digit 2, we must purchase at least 7 packages.\n\nWhen we purchase 7 packages, we have 7 of each digit. We have enough of the digits 0 and 3 through 9. We need 46 of the digit 1, and 7 packages provide 7*9 = 63 of the digit 1, which is enough. We need 64 of the digit 2, and 7 packages provide 7*9 = 63 of the digit 2, which is not enough.\n\nSo, we must purchase at least 8 packages to have enough of all the digits.
