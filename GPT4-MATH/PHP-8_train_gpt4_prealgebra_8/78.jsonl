{"question": "Of the 60 students in the drama club, 36 take mathematics, 27 take physics and 20 students take both mathematics and physics. How many drama club students take neither mathematics nor physics?", "answer": "There are $36 - 20=16$ students taking only math, $27-20=7$ taking only physics, and 20 taking both.  That leaves $60-16-7-20=\\boxed{ 17}$ students taking neither.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of students who take either mathematics or physics or both.\nThe number of students who take mathematics or physics is equal to the sum of those who take mathematics and those who take physics, minus those who take both.\nSo, the number of students taking either mathematics or physics is 36 + 27 - 20 = 43 students.\nNow, to find the number of students who take neither mathematics nor physics, we subtract the number of students taking either mathematics or physics from the total number of students in the drama club.\nThus, the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics is 60 - 43 = 17 students.\nThe answer is 17.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find out how many students take either mathematics or physics (or both).\nNumber of students taking either mathematics or physics = number of students taking mathematics + number of students taking physics - number of students taking both.\nSo, the number of students taking either mathematics or physics = 36 + 27 - 20 = 43.\nNow, we know that there are 60 students in total in the drama club, so the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics = 60 - 43 = 17.\nThe answer is 17.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to solve this problem.\nThe total number of students taking either mathematics or physics is the sum of the number of students taking each subject minus the number of students taking both subjects.\nSo, the number of students taking either mathematics or physics is $36 + 27 - 20 = 43$.\nSince there are 60 students in the drama club, the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics is $60 - 43 = \\boxed{17}$.\nThe answer is 17", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of students taking at least one of the subjects (mathematics or physics).\nThe number of students taking mathematics or physics or both is equal to the sum of students taking mathematics and students taking physics, minus the number of students taking both subjects.\nSo, there are $36 + 27 - 20 = 43$ students taking at least one of the subjects.\nNow, we subtract this number from the total number of students in the drama club to find the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics: $60 - 43 = \\boxed{17}$.\nThe answer is 17.", "Let's think step by step\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nThere are 36 students taking mathematics and 27 taking physics, so there are $36 + 27 = 63$ students taking at least one of these subjects.\nHowever, since 20 students take both mathematics and physics, we have counted them twice.\nSo, there are $63 - 20 = 43$ students taking either mathematics or physics or both.\nSince there are 60 students in the drama club, there are $60 - 43 = \\boxed{17}$ students taking neither mathematics nor physics.\nThe answer is 17.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who take either math or physics or both:\nTotal students taking math or physics = Students taking math + Students taking physics - Students taking both math and physics\nTotal students taking math or physics = 36 + 27 - 20 = 43\n\nNow, to find the number of students who take neither math nor physics, we subtract the number of students taking math or physics from the total number of students in the drama club:\nStudents taking neither math nor physics = Total students - Students taking math or physics\nStudents taking neither math nor physics = 60 - 43 = \\boxed{17}\nThe answer is 17.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\nThe total number of students taking mathematics or physics is the sum of those taking mathematics and those taking physics, minus those taking both:\n$36 + 27 - 20 = 43$ students.\nNow, we know there are 60 students in the drama club, so the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics is:\n$60 - 43 = \\boxed{17}$ students.\nThe answer is 17", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who take at least one of mathematics or physics:\n\nNumber of students taking at least one = (Number taking mathematics) + (Number taking physics) - (Number taking both)\n\n= 36 + 27 - 20 = 43\n\nNow, we subtract this number from the total number of students in the drama club to find the number of students taking neither:\n\nNumber of students taking neither = (Total number of students) - (Number taking at least one)\n\n= 60 - 43 = 17\n\nSo, there are 17 drama club students who take neither mathematics nor physics.
