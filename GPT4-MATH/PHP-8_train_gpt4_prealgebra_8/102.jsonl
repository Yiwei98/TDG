There are 7 points to choose from for the first point, and 6 points left to choose from for the second point. However, since the order of the points does not matter (i.e., connecting point A to point B is the same as connecting point B to point A), we must divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. So, there are $\\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = \\boxed{21}$ different chords that can be drawn.", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 7 points, and we need to choose 2 of them to form a chord.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 points out of 7 is given by the combination formula:\n$\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7!}{2!5!} = \\frac{7\\times6}{2\\times1} = 7\\times3 = \\boxed{21}$.\nSo, 21 different chords can be drawn."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Prealgebra"}
