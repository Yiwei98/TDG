{"question": "Yan is  somewhere between his home and the stadium. To get to the stadium he can walk directly to the stadium, or else he can walk home and then ride his bicycle to the stadium.  He rides 7 times as fast as he walks, and both choices require the same amount of time.

The time required for Yan to walk to the stadium is $y/w$, and the time required for him to walk home is $x/w$.  Because he rides his bicycle at a speed of $7w$, the time required for him to ride his bicycle from his home to the stadium is $(x+y)/(7w)$. Thus \\[\\frac{y}{w}=\\frac{x}{w}+\\frac{x+y}{7w} = \\frac{8x + y}{7w}.\\]As a consequence, $7y = 8x + y$, so  $8x=6y$.

Therefore, the sum of their measures is $180^\\circ$. We can write this as an equation: $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the equation $\\angle 3 = \\frac{1}{8}\\angle 4$ into this equation, we get $\\frac{1}{8}\\angle 4 + \\angle 4 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$. Combining like terms, we have $\\frac{9}{8}\\angle 4 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$.\n\nWe are trying to find the measure of $\\angle 5$. To do this, we need to find the measure of $\\angle 4$. Since $\\angle 4$ is congruent to $\\angle 2$, we can write the equation $\\angle 4 = \\angle 2$. We know that $\\angle 2 = 8\\angle 1$ because $\\angle 1 = \\frac{1}{8}\\angle 2$. We also know that $\\angle 1$ and $\\angle 2$ are supplementary because they form a straight line with $\\angle 3$. Therefore, $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the equation $\\angle 2 = 8\\angle 1$ into this equation, we get $\\angle 1 + 8\\angle 1 = 180^\\circ$. Combining like terms, we have $9\\angle 1 = 180^\\circ$. Dividing both sides by 9, we find that $\\angle 1 = 20^\\circ$.\n\nNow that we know the measure of $\\angle 1$, we can find the measure of $\\angle 2$. Since $\\angle 2 = 8\\angle 1$, we have $\\angle 2 = 8(20^\\circ) = 160^\\circ$. Since $\\angle 4 = \\angle 2$, we have $\\angle 4 = 160^\\circ$. Now we can find the measure of $\\angle 5$ using the equation $\\frac{9}{8}\\angle 4 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the measure of $\\angle 4$ into this equation, we get $\\frac{9}{8}(160^\\circ) + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$. Multiplying, we have $180^\\circ + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$. Subtracting $180^\\circ$ from both sides, we find that the measure of $\\angle 5$ is $\\boxed{0^\\circ}$."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra"}
