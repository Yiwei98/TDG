The area of the smaller circle is equal to the area of the unshaded region in the larger circle. Since the area of the larger circle is $64\\pi$, the area of the unshaded region in the larger circle is $64\\pi - 32\\pi = 32\\pi$. Therefore, we have $\\pi r^2 = 32\\pi$, so $r^2 = 32$ and $r = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we can find the area of the smaller shaded region, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi(32) = 16\\pi$. Thus, the total area of the shaded regions is $32\\pi - 16\\pi = \\boxed{16\\pi}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first find the radius of the larger circle. Since the area is $64\\pi$, we have $\\pi r^2 = 64\\pi$, so $r^2 = 64$ and $r = 8$. Thus, the diameter of the larger circle is 16.\n\nNow, let $A$ and $B$ be the points where the two shaded semicircles meet the diameter of the larger circle, and let $C$ be the point where the two circles intersect. Then, triangle $OAC$ is a right triangle with right angle at $C$. Since the radius of the smaller circle is half the radius of the larger circle, $AC = 4$ and $OC = 8$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $OA = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSince $OA$ is the diameter of the smaller circle, the area of the smaller circle is $\\pi (2\\sqrt{3})^2 = 12\\pi$. The shaded area is half of the area of the smaller circle, so it is $6\\pi$. The area of the larger shaded region is half the area of the larger circle, which is $32\\pi$. Thus, the total shaded area is $6\\pi + 32\\pi = \\boxed{38\\pi}$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Prealgebra"}
