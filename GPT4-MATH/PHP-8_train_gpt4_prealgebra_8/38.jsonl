Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 39^2 = 1521$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers, we need to find two integers whose squares sum to 1521. We can start by finding the largest possible value for $a$, which occurs when $b$ is minimized. Since $a < b$, the minimum value for $b$ is $a + 1$. Then, we have $a^2 + (a+1)^2 = 1521$.\nExpanding, we get $2a^2 + 2a - 1520 = 0$. Dividing by 2, we have $a^2 + a - 760 = 0$. We can now look for two factors of 760 that differ by 1. The factors 19 and 20 meet this condition, so $a^2 + a - 760 = (a-19)(a+20) = 0$. Since $a$ is positive, we have $a = 19$.\nThus, the length of the shorter leg is $\\boxed{19}$ units.", "Let's think step by step\nSince the hypotenuse has length 39 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 39^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs.\nWe are looking for the integer solution with the smallest positive value for $a$.\nWe can start by testing the smallest possible value for $a$, which is 1.\nIf $a=1$, then $b^2 = 39^2 - 1^2 = 1520$, and $b$ is not an integer.\nIf $a=2$, then $b^2 = 39^2 - 2^2 = 1515$, and $b$ is not an integer.\nIf $a=3$, then $b^2 = 39^2 - 3^2 = 1506$, and $b$ is not an integer.\nIf $a=4$, then $b^2 = 39^2 - 4^2 = 1493$, and $b$ is not an integer.\nIf $a=5$, then $b^2 = 39^2 - 5^2 = 1476$, and $b$ is an integer because $1476 = 36^2$.\nSo, the length of the shorter leg is $\\boxed{5}$ units.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the lengths of the legs be $a$ and $b$, with $a < b$. Since the triangle is a right triangle with integer side lengths, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = 39^2$. We want to find the value of $a$ when $a$ is minimized.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers, we can use the fact that the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triple is odd, and the legs are of opposite parity (one even, one odd). Without loss of generality, let $a$ be even and $b$ be odd.\n\nNow, let $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n + 1$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Substituting these into the equation, we get $(2m)^2 + (2n + 1)^2 = 39^2$. Simplifying, we get $4m^2 + 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 39^2$.
