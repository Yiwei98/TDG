Therefore, there is at most one solution for $y$ in this interval.\n\nNow, let's try some values of $y$ to see if we can find a solution. If $y = 1$, then $(2 - \\sqrt{y})^4 = 1^4 = 1$, but $34 - y = 33$. If $y = 2$, then $(2 - \\sqrt{y})^4 = 0^4 = 0$, but $34 - y = 32$. If $y = 4$, then $(2 - \\sqrt{y})^4 = (-\\sqrt{4})^4 = 4$, but $34 - y = 30$. Finally, if $y = 9$, then $(2 - \\sqrt{y})^4 = (-1)^4 = 1$, and $34 - y = 25$. Thus, we have found one solution: $y = 9$.\n\nSince $y = x^2$, this means $x^2 = 9$, so $x = \\pm 3$. Therefore, the solutions are $\\boxed{-3, 3}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $y = 2 - x$. Then the equation becomes $x^4 + y^4 = 34$.\nNow, notice that $x^4$ and $y^4$ are both non-negative, so each of them must be less than or equal to 34.\nIf $x^4 > 16$ or $y^4 > 16$, then $x^4 + y^4 > 32$, which is not possible. So we must have $x^4 \\le 16$ and $y^4 \\le 16$.\nThis means that $|x| \\le 2$ and $|y| \\le 2$. But since $y = 2 - x$, we have $|2 - x| \\le 2$.\nSolving this inequality, we get $0 \\le x \\le 4$. So the possible values of $x$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\nNow we test each of these values in the original equation:\n- For $x = 0$, we have $y^4 = 34$, which has no solutions for $y$.\n- For $x = 1$, we have $y^4 = 33$, which has no solutions for $y$.\n- For $x = 2$, we have $y^4 = 16$, which has solutions $y = \\pm 2$. But since $y = 2 - x$, we have $x = 0$ or $x = 4$.\n- For $x = 3$, we have $y^4 = 1$, which has solutions $y = \\pm 1$. But since $y = 2 - x$, we have $x = 1$ or $x = 3$.\n- For $x = 4$, we have $y^4 = 0$, which has a solution $y = 0$. But since $y = 2 - x$, we have $x = 2$.\n\nSo the solutions are $x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
