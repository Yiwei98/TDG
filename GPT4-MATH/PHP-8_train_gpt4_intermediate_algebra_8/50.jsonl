{"question": "A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall. It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom. Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$-th centimeter. (The candle burns down each individual centimeter at a fixed rate.)\n\nSuppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely. Compute the candle's height in centimeters $\\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit.", "answer": "Since the candle is $119$ centimeters tall, the time the candle takes to burn down is \\[T = \\sum_{k=1}^{119} 10k = 10 \\cdot \\frac{119 \\cdot 120}{2} = 71400.\\]We want to compute the height of the candle at time $\\tfrac{T}{2} = 35700$ seconds. Suppose that, at this time, the first $m$ centimeters have burnt down completely, but not the $(m+1)$st centimeter completely. Then we must have \\[\\sum_{k=1}^m 10k \\le 35700 < \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} 10k\\](the first quantity is the time it takes for the first $m$ centimeters to burn down; the last is the time it takes for the first $(m+1)$ centimeters to burn down). This simplifies to \\[5m(m+1) \\le 35700 < 5(m+1)(m+2).\\]To find $m$, we note that we should have $5m^2 \\approx 35700$, or $m^2 \\approx 7140$, so $m \\approx 85$. Trying values of $m$, we find that when $m=84$, \\[5m(m+1) = 35700\\]exactly. Therefore, at time $\\tfrac{T}{2}$, exactly the first $84$ centimeters have burnt down, and nothing more, so the height of the remaining part of the candle is $119 - 84 = \\boxed{35}$ centimeters.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the total time it takes for the candle to burn down completely.\nThe time it takes to burn down the $k$-th centimeter is $10k$ seconds, so the total time is the sum of the first 119 terms of the arithmetic series $10, 20, 30, \\ldots, 10 \\cdot 119$.\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the total time is $\\frac{10 + 10 \\cdot 119}{2} \\cdot 119 = 10 \\cdot 119 \\cdot 60 = 71400$ seconds.\n\nNow, we want to find the height of the candle after $\\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{71400}{2} = 35700$ seconds.\nWe can start by finding the largest $k$ such that the sum of the first $k$ terms of the arithmetic series is less than or equal to 35700.\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we have:\n\\[\\frac{10 + 10k}{2} \\cdot k \\le 35700\\]\n\\[5(1+k)k \\le 35700\\]\nWe can test values of $k$ to find that $k=33$ satisfies the inequality, while $k=34$ does not.\nSo, after 35700 seconds, the candle has burned down 33 centimeters completely.\n\nNow, we need to find how much of the 34th centimeter has burned down in the remaining time.\nThere are $35700 - \\frac{10 + 10 \\cdot 33}{2} \\cdot 33 = 2310$ seconds left.\nSince the 34th centimeter takes $10 \\cdot 34 = 340$ seconds to burn down completely, in 2310 seconds, it burns down $\\frac{2310}{340} = \\frac{231}{34}$ of the 34th centimeter.\n\nThus, the height of the candle after $\\frac{T}{2}$ seconds is $119 - 33 - \\frac{231}{34} = \\boxed{\\frac{3825}{34}}$ centimeters.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the total time $T$ it takes for the candle to burn down completely. This is the sum of an arithmetic series with first term $10$, common difference $10$, and 119 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. In this case, $n = 119$, $a_1 = 10$, and $a_n = 10(119) = 1190$. So, $T = \\frac{119}{2}(10 + 1190) = \\frac{119}{2}(1200) = 71400$.\n\nNow, we want to find the candle's height $\\frac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit, which is 35700 seconds. We can find how many centimeters have burned by summing the arithmetic series until the sum is greater than 35700. Let $k$ be the number of centimeters burned. Then, we want to find the smallest $k$ such that $\\frac{k}{2}(10 + 10k) > 35700$.\n\nWe can simplify the inequality to $k^2 + k > 7140$. Testing values, we find that $k = 84$ satisfies the inequality, as $84^2 + 84 = 7140$ and $85^2 + 85 = 7220$. So, 84 centimeters have burned after 35700 seconds.\n\nSince the candle was initially 119 centimeters tall, its height after 35700 seconds is $119 - 84 = \\boxed{35}$ centimeters.", "Let's think step by step\nThe total time it takes for the candle to burn down completely is given by the sum\n\\[T = 10 + 20 + \\cdots + 10 \\cdot 119 = 10(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 119).\\]\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we have\n\\[T = 10 \\cdot \\frac{119 \\cdot 120}{2} = 71400.\\]\nHalfway through this time, $\\frac{T}{2} = 35700$ seconds have passed.\n\nNow, we want to find how many centimeters have burned down in $35700$ seconds.\nFirst, we find the largest $k$ such that the sum $10(1 + 2 + \\cdots + k)$ is less than or equal to $35700$.\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series again, we have\n\\[10 \\cdot \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\le 35700.\\]\nSolving for $k$, we find that the largest such $k$ is $k = 26$. In other words, $26$ centimeters have burned down completely in $35700$ seconds.\n\nNow, we need to find how much of the $27$th centimeter has burned down.\nWe have $10(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 26) = 35100$ seconds accounted for, so there are $35700 - 35100 = 600$ seconds left.\nSince the $27$th centimeter takes $10 \\cdot 27 = 270$ seconds to burn down completely, in $600$ seconds, $\\frac{600}{270} = \\frac{20}{9}$ of the $27$th centimeter has burned down.\n\nThus, the candle's height after $\\frac{T}{2}$ seconds is $119 - 26 - \\frac{20}{9} = \\boxed{92\\frac{7}{9}}$ centimeters.", "Let's think step by step\nLet's first find the total time $T$ it takes for the candle to burn down completely.\nThe time it takes to burn down the $k$-th centimeter is $10k$ seconds, so the total time is given by the sum of the first 119 terms of the arithmetic series with first term 10 and common difference 10: \\[T = 119(2\\cdot 10 + (119-1)10)/2 = 119(1200)/2 = 119\\cdot 600.\\]\nNow, we want to find the height of the candle $\\frac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit, which is $119\\cdot 300$ seconds.\nLet $h$ be the height of the candle at this time. Then, the candle has burned down $119-h$ centimeters.\nThe time it takes to burn down the first $119-h$ centimeters is given by the sum of the first $119-h$ terms of the arithmetic series with first term 10 and common difference 10: \\[(119-h)(2\\cdot 10 + (119-h-1)10)/2 = (119-h)(1200-10h)/2.\\]\nWe want this time to be equal to $119\\cdot 300$ seconds, so we have the equation: \\[(119-h)(1200-10h)/2 = 119\\cdot 300.\\]\nDividing both sides by $119/2$, we get $(119-h)(1200-10h) = 600\\cdot 300$.\nExpanding the left side, we get $10h^2 - 2380h + 119\\cdot 1200 = 600\\cdot 300$.\nWe can simplify this equation to $h^2 - 238h + 119\\cdot 60 = 0$.\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $h$: \\[h = \\frac{-(-238) \\pm \\sqrt{(-238)^2 - 4(119\\cdot 60)}}{2}.\\]\nWe find that the two possible values for $h$ are approximately 22.67 and 119. Since the candle has burned down some part, the height of the candle can't be 119 centimeters.\nThus, the height of the candle $\\frac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit is approximately $\\boxed{22.67}$ centimeters.", "Let's think step by step\nTo find the height of the candle after $T/2$ seconds, we first need to find $T$. We can find the total time it takes for the candle to burn down completely by summing the time it takes to burn down each centimeter:\n$$T = 10(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 119).$$\nThis is an arithmetic series with 119 terms, a common difference of 1, and a first term of 1. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. In this case, we have:\n$$T = \\frac{119(1 + 119)}{2} \\cdot 10 = 7140 \\cdot 10 = 71400.$$\nNow we want to find the height of the candle after $T/2 = 35700$ seconds. We can start subtracting the time it takes to burn each centimeter from 35700 until we reach a non-positive value. This will tell us how many centimeters have been burned:\n\n$$35700 - 10(1) = 35690$$\n$$35690 - 10(2) = 35670$$\n$$35670 - 10(3) = 35640$$\n$$\\cdots$$\n\nContinuing this process, we find that after 29 centimeters have been burned, we have:\n\n$$35700 - 10(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 29) = 35700 - 10\\cdot\\frac{29(1+29)}{2} = 20$$\n\nSince there are 20 seconds left after 29 centimeters have been burned, and it takes 30 * 10 = 300 seconds to burn down the 30th centimeter, the candle will burn an additional $\\frac{20}{300} = \\frac{1}{15}$ of a centimeter in the remaining 20 seconds.

We know that $10(1 + 2 + \\dots + k)$ seconds have passed after $k$ centimeters have burned.

We can try some values and find that $k = 84$ works, but $k = 85$ does not.
