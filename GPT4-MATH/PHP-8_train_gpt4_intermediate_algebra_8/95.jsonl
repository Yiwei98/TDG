Thus, each pair sums to $\\lfloor 1+1.6 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.6 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThere are $\\frac{100-1}{0.6} = 165$ terms in the arithmetic progression, so there are $\\frac{165}{2} = 82.5$ pairs. However, since there are an odd number of terms, one term is left unpaired. In this case, the unpaired term is the last term, $\\lfloor 100 \\rfloor = 100$.\n\nThus, the sum is $82(2)+100 = \\boxed{264}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
