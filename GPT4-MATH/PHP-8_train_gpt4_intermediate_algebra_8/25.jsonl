If a root occurs more than once, enter it as many times as its multiplicity.", "answer": "By the Rational Root Theorem, any root of the polynomial must divide $9$. Therefore the roots are among the numbers $\\pm 1,3$. Since these are only four values, we can try all of them to find that $x=3$ and $x=-1$ are roots and $x=-3$ and $x=1$ are not.\n\nSince the given polynomial is cubic, it must have three roots. This means that one of $3$ or $-1$ is a root twice (i.e. has multiplicity $2$).

To find which root occurs twice, we can divide $x^3-5x^2+3x+9$ by $x+1$ to get  $x^3-5x^2+3x+9 = (x+1)(x^2-6x+9)$.\n\nWe can factorise $x^2-6x+9$ as $(x-3)^2$ which means that the root $x=3$ has multiplicity 2.
