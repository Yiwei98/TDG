In this case, we need $1 \\le \\frac{x}{9} \\le 3$, which gives us $9 \\le x \\le 27$. The smallest possible $x$ in this range is $x = 9$, which gives us $f(x) = 3^2 f(1) = 3^2 (1 - |1 - 2|) = 3^2$.\n\nHowever, we need to check if $k = 1$ is possible.

The smallest possible $x$ in this range is $x = 3$, which gives us $f(x) = 3f(1) = 3(1 - |1 - 2|) = 3$.\n\nSince $f(2001) = 3^3 f\\left(\\frac{2001}{27}\\right)$ and $f(9) = 3^2$, we see that $f(9) \\neq f(2001)$.

Since $f(3x) = 3f(x)$, we have $f(2001) = f(3\\cdot 667) = 3f(667)$. Continuing, $f(667) = f(3\\cdot 222.333) = 3f(222.333)$. Since $222.333 = 3\\cdot 74.111$, we have $f(222.333) = 3f(74.111)$. Finally, $74.111 = 3\\cdot 24.703$, so $f(74.111) = 3f(24.703)$. Thus, we have $f(2001) = 3^4 f(24.703)$.\n\nSince $f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|$ for $1\\leq x \\leq 3$, we have $f(24.703) = 1 - |24.703 - 2| = 1 - 22.703 = -21.703$.

We can see that when $k=4$, the left side of the equation is in the range $[-3, 1]$, and when $k=5$, the left side of the equation is in the range $[-9, 3]$. Since $-19683.207$ is in the range $[-9, 3]$, we must have $k=5$. Then, we have $1 - |y - 2| = \\frac{-19683.207}{3^5} = -21.703$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 2 + 22.703 = 24.703$.
