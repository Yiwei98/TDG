Squaring both sides, we have $(-b)^2 + b^2 = 25$, which simplifies to $2b^2 = 25$. Thus, $b^2 = \\frac{25}{2}$, and $b = \\pm\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}$. For each value of $b$, we have a corresponding value of $a = -b$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ values of $z$ that satisfy both conditions.", "Let's think step by step\nIf $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then $\\overline{z} = a - bi$, and $f(z) = i(a - bi) = -b + ai$.\nWe are given that $|z| = 5$, so $a^2 + b^2 = 25$.\nWe want to find the values of $z$ that satisfy $f(z) = z$, which means $-b + ai = a + bi$.\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get $-b = a$ and $a = b$.\nSince $a = -b$, we have $a = b = -a$, so $a = b = 0$.\nHowever, this contradicts the fact that $a^2 + b^2 = 25$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ values of $z$ that satisfy both conditions."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
