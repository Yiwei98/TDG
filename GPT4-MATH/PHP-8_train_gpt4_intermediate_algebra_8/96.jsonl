Clearing the denominators, we get $9x^2+400x-1600=225x^2$. Simplifying, we have $216x^2-400x+1600=0$. Factoring, we get $16(9x^2-25x+100)=16(x-1)(9x-100)=0$. Thus, the points of intersection have $x$-coordinates $1$ and $\\frac{100}{9}$.\n\nSince the ellipse and parabola are symmetric about the $x$-axis, the points of intersection have the same $y$-coordinate. Thus, the distance between the points of intersection is the difference in their $x$-coordinates, which is $\\frac{100}{9}-1=\\frac{91}{9}$. Therefore, the distance between the two points is $\\boxed{\\frac{91}{9}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThe given ellipse has foci $(\\pm 4,0)$ and vertices $(\\pm 5,0).$ Let the parabola have focus $(4,0)$ and directrix $x=-5.$ Then the equation of the parabola is \\[\ny^2=4(9)(x+1)\n\\] (since the distance from the parabola to the focus is $4(9)$ times the distance from the parabola to the directrix). The intersections of the ellipse and parabola satisfy both equations, so \\[\n\\frac{x^2}{25}+\\frac{4(9)(x+1)}{25}=1.\n\\] We can rewrite this as \\[\nx^2+36(x+1)=25,\n\\] or $x^2+36x+11=0.$ By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $-36,$ so the other root is $-36-x.$ The distance between the roots is \\[\n-36-x-(x)=-36-2x,\n\\] and by difference of squares, this is \\[\n\\sqrt{(-36-2x)^2-(2x)^2}=\\sqrt{1296-144x^2}=\\sqrt{1296-144(25-11)}=\\boxed{12\\sqrt{11}}.\n\\] The answer is 12\\sqrt{11}."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
