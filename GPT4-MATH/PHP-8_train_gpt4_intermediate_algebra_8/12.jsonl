Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation is equal to:\n\n\\[\\frac{98}{(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-100)}.\\]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\\frac{98}{(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-100)} = x.\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-100)$, we get:\n\n\\[98 = x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-100).\\]\n\nNotice that $x$ must be one of the factors on the right-hand side, since otherwise, the product would be a multiple of 100. Thus, the equation has exactly $\\boxed{1}$ real solution, which is $x = 98$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first note that $x$ cannot be any of the numbers $1,2,\\dots,100$, as the left-hand side of the equation would be undefined. Now, let's consider the function $f(x) = x - \\left(\\frac{1}{x - 1} + \\frac{2}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 3} + \\dots + \\frac{100}{x - 100}\\right)$. We want to find the number of real solutions to $f(x) = 0$.\n\nObserve that $f(x)$ is continuous for all $x$ except $x \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$. We will now show that $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for all $x$ except $x \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$.\n\nTaking the derivative of $f(x)$, we get\n\\[f'(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{(x - 1)^2} + \\frac{2}{(x - 2)^2} + \\frac{3}{(x - 3)^2} + \\dots + \\frac{100}{(x - 100)^2}.\\]\nSince all the terms in the sum are positive, $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ except $x \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$. This implies that $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for all $x$ except $x \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ around the points where it is not continuous. For $x < 1$, we have $f(x) < 1 - \\frac{1}{0} = -\\infty$. For $1 < x < 2$, we have $f(x) > 1 - \\frac{1}{0} = \\infty$. Similarly, for $2 < x < 3$, we have $f(x) < 2 - \\frac{1}{0} = -\\infty$, and so on. Thus, between every two consecutive integers from 1 to 100, $f(x)$ changes sign. Since $f(x)$ is strictly increasing in these intervals, there must be exactly one solution to $f(x) = 0$ in each of these intervals. Finally, for $x > 100$, we have $f(x) > x - \\frac{1}{0} = \\infty$, so there are no solutions for $x > 100$.\n\nIn total, there are $\\boxed{99}$ real solutions to the equation.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we notice that the expression on the left is undefined when $x$ is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.\nWe can rewrite the equation as\n\\[\\frac{1}{x - 1} = x - \\left(\\frac{2}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 3} + \\dots + \\frac{100}{x - 100}\\right).\\]\nThe expression in the parentheses is positive, so the left side is positive, which means $x > 1$. Also, the expression in the parentheses increases as $x$ decreases, so the right side is decreasing as $x$ increases. Thus, there is at most one solution in the interval $(1, 2)$.\n\nNow, consider the equation\n\\[\\frac{2}{x - 2} = x - \\left(\\frac{1}{x - 1} + \\frac{3}{x - 3} + \\dots + \\frac{100}{x - 100}\\right).\\]\nThe expression in the parentheses is positive, so the left side is positive, which means $x > 2$.
