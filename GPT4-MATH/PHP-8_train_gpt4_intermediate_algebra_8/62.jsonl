Any value of $x$ that makes the first equation true must also satisfy \\[(x+a)(x+b)(x+12) = 0.\\]Therefore, the only possible roots of the first equation are $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12.$ Because the first equation has three distinct roots, it must be that $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12$ are all distinct and all satisfy the first equation. This means that $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12$ cannot equal $-3,$ since when $x=-3$ in the first equation, the denominator of the fraction becomes zero. In conclusion, from the first equation having $3$ distinct roots, we discern that all of the numbers $-a,$ $-b,$ $-12,$ and $-3$ are distinct. That is, all the numbers $a,$ $b,$ $3,$ and $12$ are distinct.\n\nThen $-3$ is necessarily a root of the second equation, because when $x = -3,$ the numerator is zero, while the denominator is nonzero. Thus, $-3$ must be the only root of the second equation.

The denominator is $(x+6)(x+12)=0,$ so either $-2a + 6 = 0$ or $-2a + 12 = 0,$ which means either $a = 3$ or $a = 6.$ But we know that $a,$ $b,$ $3,$ and $12$ are distinct, and $b=6,$ so this is impossible.
