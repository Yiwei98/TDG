So, we have the equations $1-a+b=0$ and $1-b+c=0$.\nNow, let's consider the least common multiple of the two polynomials, which is $x^3-4x^2+x+6$. Since the two polynomials are quadratic, their product must be equal to the least common multiple, up to a constant factor.

Since $1-a+b=1-b+c$, this simplifies to $(1-a+b)^2=k(2)$.\nSince the left-hand side is a perfect square and the right-hand side is twice a perfect square, we must have $k=1$ or $k=2$.

If $(a,b)=(-1,2)$, then the two polynomials are $x^2-x+2$ and $x^2+2x+2$, which do have $x+1$ as their greatest common divisor, and their product is $(x^3-4x^2+x+6)$, as desired.

Since they share a factor of $(x+1)$, the least common multiple is $(x+1)(x+a+1)(x+b+1)$.\nWe are given that the least common multiple is $x^3-4x^2+x+6$. Expanding the expression we found for the least common multiple, we get $(x+1)(x^2+(a+b+2)x+(a+1)(b+1))$.\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of the powers of $x$ in the two expressions for the least common multiple.
