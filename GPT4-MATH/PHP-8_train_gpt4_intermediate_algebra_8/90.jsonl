We want to find $c_k = a_k + b_k$.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n$$a_{k-1} = 1 + (k-2)d$$\n$$a_{k+1} = 1 + kd$$\n$$b_{k-1} = r^{k-2}$$\n$$b_{k+1} = r^k$$\n\nSince $c_{k-1} = 100$, we have $a_{k-1} + b_{k-1} = 100$. Similarly, since $c_{k+1} = 1000$, we have $a_{k+1} + b_{k+1} = 1000$.\n\nNow, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n$$(1 + kd) + r^k - (1 + (k-2)d) - r^{k-2} = 900$$\n$$kd - (k-2)d + r^k - r^{k-2} = 900$$\n$$2d + r^k(1 - r^{-2}) = 900$$\n\nNow, let's find an expression for $c_k = a_k + b_k$. We have:\n$$a_k = 1 + (k-1)d$$\n$$b_k = r^{k-1}$$\nSo, $c_k = 1 + (k-1)d + r^{k-1}$.\n\nTo find $c_k$, we need to find a relationship between $d$ and $r$. We can rewrite the equation we derived earlier as:\n$$2d = 900 - r^k(1 - r^{-2}) = 900 - r^k + r^{k-2}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the expression for $c_k$:\n$$c_k = 1 + (k-1)d + r^{k-1} = 1 + (k-1)(900 - r^k + r^{k-2})/2 + r^{k-1}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$c_k = 1 + \\frac{900(k-1)}{2} - (k-1)r^k + \\frac{(k-1)r^{k-2}}{2} + r^{k-1}$$\n\nNow, notice that the term $(k-1)r^k$ cancels out with the term $- (k-1)r^k$ in the expression for $c_k$. So, we are left with:\n$$c_k = 1 + \\frac{900(k-1)}{2} + \\frac{(k-1)r^{k-2}}{2} + r^{k-1}$$\n\nSince $c_{k-1} = 100$ and $c_{k+1} = 1000$, we know that $c_k$ must be between $100$ and $1000$. We can now try different values of $k$ and check if the expression for $c_k$ satisfies the given conditions.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that $k=4$ satisfies the conditions. For $k=4$, we have $d = 150$ and $r = 3$. So, the expression for $c_k$ becomes:\n$$c_k = 1 + \\frac{900(3)}{2} + \\frac{3\\cdot 3^2}{2} + 3^3 = 1 + 1350 + 13.5 + 27 = \\boxed{1391.5}$$\n\nThe answer is 1391.5", "Let's think step by step\nSince $1, a_2, a_3, \\dots$ is an increasing arithmetic sequence, we have $a_n = 1 + (n-1)d$ for some positive integer $d$. \nSince $1, b_2, b_3, \\dots$ is an increasing geometric sequence, we have $b_n = r^{n-1}$ for some integer $r > 1$. \nNow, we have $c_n = a_n + b_n = 1 + (n-1)d + r^{n-1}$. \nWe are given $c_{k-1} = 100$ and $c_{k+1} = 1000$. \nSubstituting these into the equation for $c_n$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n100 &= 1 + (k-2)d + r^{k-2}, \\\\\n1000 &= 1 + kd + r^k.\n\\end{align*}\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n900 &= 2d + r^k - r^{k-2}.\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we notice that $r^k - r^{k-2} = r^{k-2}(r^2 - 1) = (r-1)r^{k-2}(r+1)$, which is divisible by 3 since either $r-1$, $r$, or $r+1$ is divisible by 3. \nThus, $900 = 2d + 3m$ for some integer $m$, which implies $d = 450 - \\frac{3}{2}m$. \nSince $d$ is a positive integer, $m$ must be even. Let $m = 2n$. Then, $d = 450 - 3n$ and $r^k - r^{k-2} = 6n$. \n\nNow, we look for possible values of $n$ and $r$. Since $r^k - r^{k-2} = 6n > 0$, we have $r^k > r^{k-2}$. \nThis means that $r^2 > 1$, which is true for all $r > 1$. Thus, we can focus on finding the possible values of $n$. \nWe have $6n = r^{k-2}(r^2 - 1) < r^{k-2}r^2 = r^k$. \nSince $r^k < 1000$, we have $6n < 1000$. The possible values of $n$ are then 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 166. \n\nWe now look for values of $n$ and $r$ that satisfy the equation $6n = r^{k-2}(r^2 - 1)$. \nWe can start by testing the largest possible value of $n$, which is 166. \nIf $n = 166$, then $6n = 996$. We need to find an integer $r > 1$ such that $r^2 - 1$ divides 996. \nWe can quickly check that $r = 2$ does not work, but $r = 3$ does work since $996 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 37$, and $3^2 - 1 = 8$ divides 996. \nIn this case, we have $r^{k-2} = \\frac{996}{8} = 3^2 \\cdot 37$. Since $r = 3$, we get $k-2 = 4$, so $k = 6$. \n\nNow, we can find $c_k = a_k + b_k = (1 + (k-1)d) + r^{k-1} = (1 + 5(450 - 3n)) + 3^5 = 2251 - 15n$. \nSubstituting $n = 166$, we get $c_k = 2251 - 15(166) = \\boxed{476}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $a_2 = 1+d$ and $b_2 = 1\\cdot r$.\nThen, $a_n = 1+(n-1)d$ and $b_n = r^{n-1}$.\nWe are given that $c_{k-1}=100$ and $c_{k+1}=1000$.\nThus, $a_{k-1}+b_{k-1}=100$ and $a_{k+1}+b_{k+1}=1000$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $a_n$ and $b_n$, we get:\n$(1+(k-2)d) + r^{k-2} = 100$ and $(1+kd) + r^{k} = 1000$.\nNow, we have a system of two equations with three variables ($d$, $r$, and $k$).\nTo eliminate one variable, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:\n$2d + r^k - r^{k-2} = 900$.\nFactor out $r^{k-2}$ from the last two terms: $2d + r^{k-2}(r^2 - 1) = 900$.\nSince $r^2 - 1 = (r-1)(r+1)$, we can rewrite the equation as $2d + r^{k-2}(r-1)(r+1) = 900$.\nNow, we can try different values of $k$ to see if we can find integer values for $d$ and $r$ that satisfy the equation.\nTrying $k = 3$, we get $2d + r(r^2 - 1) = 900$.\nWe can see that $r = 3$ and $d = 8$ satisfy this equation, so $k = 3$ is a valid choice.\nNow, we can find $c_k = a_k + b_k = (1+3\\cdot 8) + 3^2 = 25 + 9 = \\boxed{34}$.\nThe answer is 34.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be $d$, and the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$.

This means that either $r$ is even, or $k$ is even.\n\nIf $r$ is even, then $b_2 = r$ is even, which means that $a_2 = 1 + d$ is odd. But this contradicts the fact that $a_2$ and $a_3$ are consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence with an even common difference. Therefore, $k$ must be even.\n\nNow we try some even values of $k$. If $k=2$, then $c_1=100$ and $c_3=1000$, which means $a_1=1$, $a_2=99$, and $a_3=1001$. However, this leads to a common difference of 98, which is too large since $a_2$ must be greater than 1. If $k=4$, then $c_3=100$ and $c_5=1000$, which means $a_3=49$, $a_4=72$, and $a_5=951$. This gives a common difference of 23, which works since $a_2=26$ is greater than 1.\n\nThus, we have $k=4$, and the common difference is 23. The arithmetic sequence is $1, 26, 49, 72, \\dots$. The geometric sequence is $1, b_2, b_3, b_4, \\dots$. Since $c_4 = a_4 + b_4 = 72 + b_4$, we have $b_4 = 1000 - 72 = 928$.
