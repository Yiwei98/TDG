Let $a_i = x$, then we have a quadratic equation $x^2 + x - S = 0$.\n\nNow, we know that the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative, since it has a real solution $a_i$.

Thus, there is one 17-tuple with sum 1, namely $(-1, -1, \\dots, -1)$.\n\nNext, let's consider $S = 2$. In this case, we have the quadratic equation $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. This quadratic equation has two integer solutions, $x = -2$ and $x = 1$. Thus, we have two possible values for each $a_i$, and since there are 17 $a_i$'s, there are $2^{17}$ possible 17-tuples.

Since a quadratic equation has at most two distinct roots, we can conclude that there are at most two distinct values for the $a_i$'s in the tuple. \n\nLet the two distinct values be $x$ and $y$, with $x$ appearing $m$ times and $y$ appearing $n$ times, where $m + n = 17$. Then, we have $S = mx + ny$. We also have $x^2 = mx + ny - x$ and $y^2 = mx + ny - y$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $(x - y)(x + y) = y - x$, or $(x - y)(x + y + 1) = -(x - y)$. Since $x \\neq y$, we can divide both sides by $x - y$, and we get $x + y + 1 = -1$, which implies $x + y = -2$. \n\nNow, we know that $x$ and $y$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + x - S = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x + y = -1$ and $xy = -S$. But we just found that $x + y = -2$, so there is a contradiction.

Let's consider the cases:\n\nCase 1: All 17 numbers are even.\nIn this case, each number is a multiple of 2. We can divide each number by 2 and obtain a new 17-tuple with the same property. We can keep dividing by 2 until at least one of the numbers becomes odd. This reduces to the case where there are exactly 4 even numbers.\n\nCase 2: There are exactly 4 even numbers.\nWe can rearrange the 17-tuple so that the first 4 numbers are even and the remaining 13 numbers are odd. Then, the sum of the squares of the first 4 numbers is a multiple of 16, and the sum of the squares of the remaining 13 numbers is 13 more than a multiple of 16. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all 17 numbers is a multiple of 16.\n\nNow we need to count the number of such 17-tuples. There are 4 even numbers and 13 odd numbers. Each of the even numbers can be either 0 or a multiple of 4, and each of the odd numbers can be either 1 or 5. This gives us $2^4 = 16$ choices for the even numbers and $2^{13} = 8192$ choices for the odd numbers.
