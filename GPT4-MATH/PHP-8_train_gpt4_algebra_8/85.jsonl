The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n\nSo, the sum of the integers from -12 to 3 is:\n\nSum = 16 * (-12 + 3) / 2 = 16 * (-9) / 2 = 16 * (-4.5) = -72\n\nNow, the sum of the integers from -1 to 3 is the sum of an arithmetic series with first term -1, last term 3, and common difference 1. There are 5 terms in this series (3 - (-1) + 1 = 5). The sum of this series is:\n\nSum = 5 * (-1 + 3) / 2 = 5 * 2 / 2 = 5 * 1 = 5\n\nFinally, we subtract the sum of the integers from -1 to 3 from the sum of the integers from -12 to 3:\n\nTotal Sum = -72 - 5 = -77\n\nThe sum of all the integers between -12.1 and 3.3 is -77.", "Let's think step by step\nThe first integer greater than -12.1 is -12, and the last integer less than 3.3 is 3.\nSo, we want to find the sum of the integers from -12 to 3.\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term -12, last term 3, and a common difference of 1.\nThe number of terms in the series is $(3 - (-12)) + 1 = 16$.\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nSo, the sum of all integers between -12.1 and 3.3 is $\\frac{16}{2}(-12 + 3) = 8(-9) = \\boxed{-72}$.\nThe answer is -72.", "Let's think step by step\nThe integers between -12.1 and 3.3 are -12, -11, -10, ..., 1, 2, 3.\nWe have a total of 12 (from -12 to -1) + 3 (from 1 to 3) + 1 (the 0) = 16 integers.\nThe sum of the integers from -12 to -1 is the negative of the sum of the integers from 1 to 12,\nso their sum is 0.\nThus, the sum of all the integers between -12.1 and 3.3 is just the sum of 1, 2, and 3, which is $\\boxed{6}$."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra"}
