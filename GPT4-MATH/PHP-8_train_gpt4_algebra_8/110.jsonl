We can write the equations of these circles as $(x - 7)^2 + (y - 13)^2 = 169$ and $y^2 - 26y + 144 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we solve for $y$ in the second equation: $y^2 - 26y + 144 = (y - 13)^2 - 25 = 0$, so $(y - 13)^2 = 25$. This gives us two possible values for $y$: $y = 8$ and $y = 18$.\n\nFor $y = 8$, we plug it into the first equation and get $(x - 7)^2 + (8 - 13)^2 = 169$.
