When we subtract $2\\cdot10^8$, we remove 8 zeros, leaving us with 8 zeros. Finally, when we add 1, we do not change the number of zeros.\nSo, there are $\\boxed{8}$ zeros in the expansion of $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$.", "Let's think step by step\nThe pattern we see is that the number of zeros in the square of a number with $n$ nines is equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to $n-1$. This can be written as the sum of an arithmetic series with first term 1, common difference 1, and $n-1$ terms, which is equal to $\\frac{(n-1)n}{2}$.\n\nIn the given problem, there are 8 nines, so $n=8$. Therefore, the number of zeros in the expansion of $99,999,999^2$ is $\\frac{(8-1)(8)}{2}=\\frac{7\\times8}{2}=\\boxed{28}$.\n\nThe answer is 28."], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra"}
