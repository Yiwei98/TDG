The area is $xy$, and we are given that the area is ten times the perimeter, so $xy = 10(180) = 1800$.\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n$x + y = 90$\n$xy = 1800$\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution or elimination. We will use substitution. From the first equation, we have $y = 90 - x$. Substitute this into the second equation:\n\n$x(90 - x) = 1800$\n$90x - x^2 = 1800$\n$x^2 - 90x + 1800 = 0$\n\nNow we can either factor this quadratic or use the quadratic formula to find the values of $x$. Factoring, we get:\n\n$(x - 60)(x - 30) = 0$\n\nSo the possible values for $x$ are 30 and 60. Since we want the largest side of the enclosure, we choose $x = 60$. Then, $y = 90 - 60 = 30$. The largest side of the enclosure is $\\boxed{60}$ feet.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are given that $2l+2w=180$ or $l+w=90$. We are also given that the area of the rectangle is ten times its perimeter, so $lw=10(2l+2w)=1800$. \n\nNow we can express $w$ in terms of $l$ using the perimeter equation: $w=90-l$. Substitute this into the area equation: $l(90-l)=1800$. This simplifies to $l^2-90l+1800=0$. \n\nTo find the largest side, we want to find the maximum value of $l$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation: $l=\\frac{-(-90)\\pm\\sqrt{(-90)^2-4(1800)}}{2}$.
