The pair $(1,150)$ does not work, since $a+b+c>0$ and $ab+bc+ac>0$. The pair $(2,75)$ does not work either, since $a+b+c$ must be an odd integer if $2(ab+bc+ac)$ is even. We can continue testing the pairs and find that the pair $(6,25)$ works with $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=3$. Therefore, $a+b+c = \\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is 6", "Let's think step by step\nWe know that $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$.\nSo, we have $3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150$.\nSince $a,b,c$ are positive integers, then $a+b,b+c,c+a$ are also positive integers.\nNow, we need to find the factors of 150.\nThe prime factorization of 150 is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^2$.\nWe can try different factorizations of 150 and see if they correspond to valid values of $a,b,$ and $c$.\nLet's try $150 = 1\\cdot 2\\cdot 75$, which corresponds to $a+b=1, b+c=2, c+a=75$.\nHowever, this leads to negative values for $a,b,$ and $c$, which is not possible.\nLet's try $150 = 1\\cdot 3\\cdot 50$, which corresponds to $a+b=1, b+c=3, c+a=50$.\nAgain, this leads to negative values for $a,b,$ and $c$.\nLet's try $150 = 1\\cdot 5\\cdot 30$, which corresponds to $a+b=1, b+c=5, c+a=30$.\nThis also leads to negative values for $a,b,$ and $c$.\nThe next factorization is $150 = 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 25$, which corresponds to $a+b=1, b+c=6, c+a=25$.\nThis gives us $a=12, b=-11,$ and $c=5$, which is not possible since $b$ is negative.\nFinally, let's try $150 = 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 25$, which corresponds to $a+b=2, b+c=3, c+a=25$.\nThis gives us $a=11, b=-9,$ and $c=2$, which is not possible since $b$ is negative.\nThe next factorization is $150 = 2\\cdot 5\\cdot 15$, which corresponds to $a+b=2, b+c=5, c+a=15$.\nThis gives us $a=7, b=-5,$ and $c=3$, which is not possible since $b$ is negative.\nFinally, let's try $150 = 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 10$, which corresponds to $a+b=3, b+c=5, c+a=10$.\nThis gives us $a=4, b=-1,$ and $c=6$, which is not possible since $b$ is negative.\nThe next factorization is $150 = 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 5$, which corresponds to $a+b=6, b+c=5, c+a=5$.\nThis gives us $a=3, b=3,$ and $c=2$, which is a valid solution since all values are positive integers.\nSo, $a+b+c = 3+3+2 = \\boxed{8}$.\nThe answer is 8", "Let's think step by step\nWe can rewrite the given equation using the factorization of the difference of cubes:\n\\[(a+b+c)((a+b+c)^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2) = 150\\]\nNow, we use the identity $x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-xz-yz=(x-y)^2+(x-z)^2+(y-z)^2$,\nso the given equation becomes:\n\\[(a+b+c)(2(a^2+b^2+c^2)-(a^2+b^2+c^2)) = 150\\]\n\\[(a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 150\\]\nSince $a, b, c$ are positive integers, we can consider the prime factorization of 150 as $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^2$.\nWe have the following possibilities for $(a+b+c)$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2)$:\n1. $(a+b+c) = 1$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 150$\n2. $(a+b+c) = 2$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 75$\n3. $(a+b+c) = 3$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 50$\n4. $(a+b+c) = 5$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 30$\n5. $(a+b+c) = 6$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 25$\n6. $(a+b+c) = 10$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 15$\n7. $(a+b+c) = 15$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 10$\n8. $(a+b+c) = 25$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 6$\n9. $(a+b+c) = 30$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 5$\n10. $(a+b+c) = 50$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 3$\n11. $(a+b+c) = 75$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 2$\n12. $(a+b+c) = 150$ and $(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 1$\n\nWe can eliminate cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 because they lead to non-integer or negative values for $a, b, c$.

Applying this to the given equation, we get\n\\[(a+b+c)((a+b)^2 - (a+b)c + c^2) - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150.\\]\nNow, note that $(a+b)^2 - (a+b)c + c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - ac - bc + c^2 = a^2 - ac + b^2 - bc + 2ab = (a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 + 2ab$.\nThus, we can rewrite the equation as\n\\[(a+b+c)((a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 + 2ab) = 150.\\]\nSince $a,b,c$ are positive integers, the factors $(a+b+c)$ and $((a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 + 2ab)$ are both positive. We can now look at the factor pairs of 150: (1,150), (2,75), (3,50), (5,30), (6,25), (10,15). We can test each of these factor pairs to see if they can be expressed in the form $(a+b+c)$ and $((a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 + 2ab)$.\n\nAfter testing the factor pairs, we find that $(a+b+c, (a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 + 2ab) = (10, 15)$.

We can now consider the possible factor pairs of 150: (1, 150), (2, 75), (3, 50), (5, 30), (6, 25), and (10, 15). We can eliminate (1, 150) and (2, 75) as possibilities, since the smallest possible value of $ab+bc+ac$ for positive integers $a, b, c$ is 3 (when $a=b=c=1$).\n\nWe proceed by trying the remaining possible pairs:\n\n- If $(a+b+c, ab+bc+ac) = (3, 50)$, then $a+b+c = 3$ and $ab+bc+ac = 50$. However, this is impossible, since the maximum value of $ab+bc+ac$ for $a+b+c = 3$ is when $a=b=c=1$, which gives $ab+bc+ac = 3$.\n\n- If $(a+b+c, ab+bc+ac) = (5, 30)$, then $a+b+c = 5$ and $ab+bc+ac = 30$. Trying different combinations of $a, b, c$, we find that $(a, b, c) = (1, 1, 3)$ works, since $ab+bc+ac = 1+3+3 = 30$. Thus, $a+b+c = \\boxed{5}$.\n\n- We can stop here since we found a valid solution. However, for completeness, we can check the remaining possibilities:\n\n- If $(a+b+c, ab+bc+ac) = (6, 25)$, then $a+b+c = 6$ and $ab+bc+ac = 25$. The smallest possible value of $ab+bc+ac$ for $a+b+c = 6$ is when $a=1, b=2, c=3$, which gives $ab+bc+ac = 11$. The maximum possible value is when $a=b=c=2$, which gives $ab+bc+ac = 12$. Thus, there is no solution in this case.\n\n- If $(a+b+c, ab+bc+ac) = (10, 15)$, then $a+b+c = 10$ and $ab+bc+ac = 15$. The smallest possible value of $ab+bc+ac$ for $a+b+c = 10$ is when $a=1, b=2, c=7$, which gives $ab+bc+ac = 23$. Thus, there is no solution in this case."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Algebra"}
