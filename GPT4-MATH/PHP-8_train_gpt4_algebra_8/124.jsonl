Since the series converges, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} ar^n = \\frac{a}{1 - r}.$$\nPlugging in the given information, we have:\n$$\\frac{a}{1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = 60.$$\nSolving for $a$, we get:\n$$a = 60 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{8}\\right) = 60 \\cdot \\frac{7}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{105}{2}}.$$\nThe answer is \\frac{105}{2}."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Algebra"}
