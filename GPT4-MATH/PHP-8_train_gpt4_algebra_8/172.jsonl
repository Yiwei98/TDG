Substituting this into the second equation, we get \\[6 - 2x - 3y = 30 - 4x - 3(3x - 2y).\\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get $x = 3y$. Now, substituting this into the equation for $z$, we get $z = 7y$. Thus, we have $x = 3y$ and $z = 7y$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for $x$ and $z$ back into one of the original equations, say the first one: \\[(3y)y = 6 - 2(3y) - 3y.\\]Solving this equation, we get $y = 1$.

Similarly, multiply the last two equations to get $y(4y+2z)z(4x+3z)=180$. Dividing the second equation by the first, we get $z(4x+3z)=5$. Since $z$ is positive, we can divide by $z$ to get $4x+3z=5$. \n\nNow we are going to eliminate $y$ from the first two equations. Divide the first equation by $x$ to get $2x+3y=6/x$. Divide the second equation by $y$ to get $4y+2z=6/y$. Now subtract the second equation from twice the first equation to get $6/x-6/y=2z$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, we can multiply by $xy$ to get $6y-6x=2xyz$. We know that $2xyz=36$, so $6y-6x=36$.
