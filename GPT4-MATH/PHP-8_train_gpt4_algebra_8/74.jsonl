We are given that the ratio of the number of pieces of cherry gum to the number of pieces of grape gum is the same in both cases, so we can write the equation:\n\n$\\frac{cx - x}{30} = \\frac{20}{gx + 5x}$\n\nWe know that $20 = cx$ and $30 = gx$, so we can substitute those values into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{20 - x}{30} = \\frac{20}{30 + 5x}$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$20(30 + 5x) = 30(20 - x)$\n\nExpanding, we have:\n\n$600 + 100x = 600 - 30x$\n\nAdding $30x$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$130x = 600$\n\nDividing by 130, we find:\n\n$x = \\boxed{20/13}$\n\nSo, each complete pack has $\\frac{20}{13}$ pieces of gum."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Algebra"}
