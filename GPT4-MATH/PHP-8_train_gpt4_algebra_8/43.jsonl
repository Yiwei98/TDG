Therefore, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible values of $A$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the roots of the equation be $r$ and $s$. Then by Vieta's formulas, we have $r+s = 1A$ and $rs = A0$. Since $r$ and $s$ are positive integers, both $1A$ and $A0$ must be positive integers as well. This means that $A$ must be at least 2, as otherwise, $A0$ would not be positive.\n\nNow, consider the prime factorization of $A0$. Since $A$ is a single digit, the only possibilities for the prime factorization of $A0$ are:\n- $A = 2$: $A0 = 20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5$\n- $A = 3$: $A0 = 30 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$\n- $A = 4$: $A0 = 40 = 2^3 \\cdot 5$\n- $A = 5$: $A0 = 50 = 2 \\cdot 5^2$\n- $A = 6$: $A0 = 60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$\n- $A = 7$: $A0 = 70 = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$\n- $A = 8$: $A0 = 80 = 2^4 \\cdot 5$\n- $A = 9$: $A0 = 90 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$\n\nSince $rs = A0$, the prime factorization of $A0$ must be split between $r$ and $s$. However, since $r+s = 1A$, the sum of the factors must have a units digit of $A$. This rules out the cases $A = 3, 6, 7, 9$, as in those cases the sum of the factors will have a units digit of $1+2=3$, which does not match the required units digit. (For example, when $A = 3$, the only possible factor pairs are $(1,30)$ and $(2,15)$, both of which have a sum with a units digit of 3.)\n\nThus, we are left with the cases $A = 2, 4, 5, 8$. We can check that in each of these cases, there is at least one pair of factors $(r,s)$ that satisfy the conditions:\n- $A = 2$: $(r,s) = (4,5)$\n- $A = 4$: $(r,s) = (8,5)$\n- $A = 5$: $(r,s) = (10,5)$\n- $A = 8$: $(r,s) = (16,5)$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values of $A$ that satisfy the conditions.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the roots of the equation be $r$ and $s$.

Let's keep this in mind.\n\nNow, consider the second equation: $u + n = t$. Since $t$ is a digit, $u$ and $n$ must also add up to a single-digit number.\n\nNext, look at the third equation: $t + c = s$. We know $t$ is a digit, so $c$ must be small enough that their sum is still a single-digit number.\n\nFinally, consider the fourth equation: $o + n + s = 12$. We know that $o$, $n$, and $s$ are all digits, so their sum must be at least 3 (if they are all 1's). Since their sum is 12, $o$, $n$, and $s$ must be 3, 4, and 5 in some order.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first equation: $c + o = u$. Since $o$ is either 3, 4, or 5, $c$ must be small enough that their sum is still a single-digit number. The only possibility for $c$ is 1, and then $o$ must be 5 and $u$ must be 6.\n\nSo, we have $c = 1$, $o = 5$, and $u = 6$. Now, let's look at the second equation: $u + n = t$. We know $u = 6$, so $n$ must be 4 and $t$ must be 0 (since $t$ is a digit and $6 + 4 = 10$).\n\nHowever, we have a contradiction since we assumed that no letter represents a zero digit. Thus, our assumption that $o$, $n$, and $s$ are 3, 4, and 5 in some order must be incorrect.\n\nLet's reconsider the fourth equation: $o + n + s = 12$. Since we can't have three distinct digits adding up to 12, there must be a repeated digit. The only possibility is $o = n = 3$ and $s = 6$.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first equation: $c + o = u$. Since $o = 3$, $c$ must be 4 and $u$ must be 7.\n\nSo, we have $c = 4$, $o = 3$, and $u = 7$. Now, let's look at the second equation: $u + n = t$.
