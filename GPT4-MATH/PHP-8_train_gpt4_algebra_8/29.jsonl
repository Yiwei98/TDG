Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \\leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\\boxed{[0,3)}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's simplify the inequality:\n$$\\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q$$\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n$$3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq) > 2p^2q(p+q)$$\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n$$3pq^3 + 3p^2q^2 + 9q^3 + 9pq^2 > 2p^3q^2 + 2p^2q^3$$\nNow, let's subtract $2p^3q^2 + 2p^2q^3$ from both sides:\n$$3pq^3 + pq^2 - 2p^3q^2 + 9q^3 - 2p^2q^3 + 9pq^2 > 0$$\nNow, let's factor out common terms:\n$$q^2(3pq + p - 2p^3) + q^3(9 - 2p^2) > 0$$\nSince $q > 0$, we can divide both sides by $q^2$:\n$$3pq + p - 2p^3 + q(9 - 2p^2) > 0$$\nNow, let's factor out $p$ from the first three terms:\n$$p(3q - 2p^2 + 1) + q(9 - 2p^2) > 0$$\nNow, let's factor out $-2p^2$ from both terms in parentheses:\n$$p(-2p^2 + 3q + 1) - 2p^2q(1 - \\frac{9}{2}) > 0$$\nNow, let's factor out $-2p^2$ from the first term in parentheses:\n$$-2p^2(p - \\frac{3q + 1}{2}) + 2p^2q(1 - \\frac{9}{2}) > 0$$\nNow, let's divide both sides by $-2p^2$ (since $p$ cannot be 0):\n$$p - \\frac{3q + 1}{2} - q(1 - \\frac{9}{2}) < 0$$\nNow, let's simplify the inequality:\n$$p - \\frac{3q + 1}{2} - \\frac{7q}{2} < 0$$\n$$p - \\frac{10q + 1}{2} < 0$$\n$$p < \\frac{10q + 1}{2}$$\nSince this inequality must hold for all $q > 0$, we must find the minimum value of $\\frac{10q + 1}{2}$.
