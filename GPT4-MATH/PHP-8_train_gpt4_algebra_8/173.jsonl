However, we must check if these solutions are valid, since the original equation has fractions and we cannot have a denominator of 0. For $n = \\frac{3}{2}$, the denominators are not 0, so it is a valid solution. For $n = 2$, the second fraction's denominator becomes 0, so it is not a valid solution.
