Since $bd=12$, we can substitute it in the equation: $\\frac{ac}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$. Simplifying, we get $ac=2$. \n\nWe have two equations: $ad+bc=11$ and $ac=2$. Since $a$ and $c$ are positive integers and $ac=2$, the only possible values for $a$ and $c$ are $1$ and $2$. Without loss of generality, let $a=1$ and $c=2$. \n\nNow, we have $d+2b=11$. Since $d$ and $b$ are positive integers, we can see that $d=1$ and $b=5$. Thus, the two fractions are $\\frac{1}{1}$ and $\\frac{2}{5}$.

Simplifying, we get $\\frac{11}{12} = 1 + \\frac{1}{6}$, which means $\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{bd}{12}$. \n\nSo, $bd = 2$. Since $b$ and $d$ are both positive, either $b = 1$ and $d = 2$, or $b = 2$ and $d = 1$. \n\nIf $b = 1$ and $d = 2$, then $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{a}{1} = a$ and $\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{c}{2}$.

Since $b$ and $d$ are integers, there are two possibilities for the pairs $(b, d)$: either $(b, d) = (1, 12)$ or $(b, d) = (2, 6)$. \n\nCase 1: $(b, d) = (1, 12)$\nIn this case, we have $ad + bc = 11$. Since $b = 1$, we can substitute $d = 12$ into the equation to get $a + 12c = 11$. However, there is no integer solution for $a$ and $c$ in this case.\n\nCase 2: $(b, d) = (2, 6)$\nIn this case, we have $ad + bc = 11$. Since $b = 2$, we can substitute $d = 6$ into the equation to get $6a + 2c = 11$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $3a + c = \\frac{11}{2}$. However, there is no integer solution for $a$ and $c$ in this case either.\n\nSince neither case yields an integer solution for $a$ and $c$, we must have made an error in assuming that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers.

Rearranging, we have $6c^2 - 11cd + d^2 = 0$. This is a quadratic in $d$, so we can apply the quadratic formula to get $d = \\frac{11c \\pm \\sqrt{(11c)^2 - 4 \\cdot 6c^2}}{2} = \\frac{11c \\pm \\sqrt{37c^2}}{2}$. \n\nSince $d$ must be a positive integer, we must have $37c^2$ be a perfect square. The smallest such $c$ is 6, in which case $37c^2 = 1332 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 37 = 36^2$. Then, $d = \\frac{11 \\cdot 6 \\pm 36}{2} = 33 \\pm 18$.
