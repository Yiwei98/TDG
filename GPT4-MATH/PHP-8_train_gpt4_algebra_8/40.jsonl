Find the values of $y$ such that $f(y)=3$.\n\nFirst, let's find the values of $y$ such that $f(y)=3$. Looking at the graph, we see that there are three points on the graph where $f(y)=3$. These points correspond to $y=-3$, $y=1$, and $y=5$.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ such that $f(x)=y$ for each of these values of $y$. For $y=-3$, there is one value of $x$ such that $f(x)=-3$. For $y=1$, there is one value of $x$ such that $f(x)=1$. For $y=5$, there is one value of $x$ such that $f(x)=5$.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $1+1+1=\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x))=3$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe are looking for the number of $x$ such that $f(f(x))=3$.\nFirst, we find the values of $x$ such that $f(x)=3$.\nFrom the graph, we can see that there are 3 such values of $x$: $x=-3$, $x=1$, and $x=5$.\nNow, we need to find how many of these 3 values also satisfy $f(f(x))=3$.\nFor $x=-3$, we have $f(-3)=3$, so $f(f(-3))=f(3)=3$.\nFor $x=1$, we have $f(1)=3$, so $f(f(1))=f(3)=3$.\nFor $x=5$, we have $f(5)=3$, so $f(f(5))=f(3)=3$.\nAll three values of $x$ satisfy $f(f(x))=3$, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ that satisfy the equation."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Algebra"}
