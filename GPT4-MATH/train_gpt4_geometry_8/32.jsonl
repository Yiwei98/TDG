Let's call the height of $\\triangle ABC$ $h_1$ and the height of $\\triangle DBC$ $h_2$. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(h_1) = \\frac{1}{2}(5)(h_1)$ and the area of $\\triangle DBC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(BD)(h_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(20)(h_2)$. \n\nNow, let's consider the height of the entire quadrilateral $ABCD$. We can call this height $h$. The area of the entire quadrilateral is $\\frac{1}{2}(AC)(h) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(h)$. \n\nSince the areas of the two triangles add up to the area of the entire quadrilateral, we have the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(5)(h_1) + \\frac{1}{2}(20)(h_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(h)$. \n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h$. Since the two triangles share a base, we can see that the height of the entire quadrilateral is the sum of the heights of the two triangles: $h = h_1 + h_2$. \n\nSubstituting this into our equation, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(5)(h_1) + \\frac{1}{2}(20)(h_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(h_1 + h_2)$. Simplifying, we get $5h_1 + 20h_2 = 12h_1 + 12h_2$. \n\nRearranging, we get $7h_1 = 8h_2$. This means that $\\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{8}{7}$. \n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between the heights and the side lengths. Since $h_1$ and $h_2$ are heights of similar triangles, we can set up a proportion: $\\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{AB}{BD} = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nHowever, we found that $\\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{8}{7}$, which contradicts our proportion. This means that the triangles are not similar, and therefore, the least possible integral number of centimeters in $BC$ is $\\boxed{13}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100); import graph; currentpen = fontsize(10pt);\npair B = (0,0), C = (13,0), A = (-5,7), D = (16,10);\n\ndraw(B--A--C--cycle); draw(B--D--C);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,W); label(\"$C$\",C,E); label(\"$D$\",D,E);\n[/asy]"], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry"}
