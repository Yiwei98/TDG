To find the height of the remaining cube, we can find the distance from the centroid of the equilateral triangle to the opposite vertex of the cube.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the centroid of the equilateral triangle. Let the vertices of the cube be $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. The centroid of the triangle with vertices $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$ is the average of these points, which is $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nNow, we want to find the distance from the centroid to the opposite vertex of the cube, which is $(1,1,1)$. Using the distance formula, the distance is:\n\n$\\sqrt{(1-\\frac{1}{3})^2 + (1-\\frac{1}{3})^2 + (1-\\frac{1}{3})^2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{2}{3})^2 + (\\frac{2}{3})^2 + (\\frac{2}{3})^2} = \\sqrt{3(\\frac{4}{9})} = \\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$\n\nThe answer is \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}.", "Let's think step by step\nThe cut forms an equilateral triangle with side length $\\sqrt{2}$ on the surface of the table.\nThe height of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$.\nThe height of the remaining cube is the height of the original cube minus the height of the equilateral triangle, which is $1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{6}}{2}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{6}}{2}", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's visualize the problem. When the corner is chopped off, the cut forms an equilateral triangle with side length 1, which is the side length of the unit cube.
