Therefore, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{35}{6}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1225}{72}}$ square inches.\nThe answer is \\frac{1225}{72}", "Let's think step by step\nLet $x = AD$ and $y = AB$. Then $BC = x-y$.\nSince the area of triangle $EFG$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(10)(7)=35$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}(x+y)(7)=35$.\nAlso, since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, the area of triangle $FAB$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(y)$, and the area of triangle $FCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(x-y)(7-y)$.\nThus, we have the following system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(x+y)(7)&=35, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}(x)(y)&=\\frac{1}{2}(x-y)(7-y).\n\\end{align*} The first equation simplifies to $x+y=10$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation and simplifying, we get $y(10-y) = (10-y)(7-y)$.\nThis simplifies to $y^2-3y=0$, so $y(3-y)=0$.\nSince the rectangle is nondegenerate, we have $y=3$ and $x=7$.\nThus, the area of the rectangle is $xy = \\boxed{\\frac{21}{2}}$ square inches.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $x = AD$.

Thus, we have the proportion \\[\n\\frac{AB}{EF} = \\frac{BE}{FG}.\n\\] We know $AB = x/2$ and $FG = EG - EG = 10 - x$. We also have $EF = EG - BE = 10 - BE$. Substituting the expressions for $AB$ and $FG$ into the proportion, we get \\[\n\\frac{x/2}{10 - BE} = \\frac{BE}{10 - x}.\n\\] Cross-multiplying gives \\[\n(10 - x)(x/2) = (10 - BE)(BE).\n\\] Since $\\triangle ABE \\sim \\triangle EFG$, we have $\\frac{BE}{EF} = \\frac{AD}{FG} = \\frac{x}{10 - x}$, so $BE = EF\\cdot\\frac{x}{10 - x}$.

Therefore, $EF = \\frac{[EFG]}{FG} = \\frac{35}{10 - x}$. Substituting this expression for $EF$ into the equation above and simplifying, we get \\[\n(10 - x)\\left(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) = \\left(10 - \\frac{35x}{10 - x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{35x}{10 - x}\\right).\n\\] Expanding both sides gives \\[\n5x^3 - 10x^2 = 350x - 1225,\n\\] so $5x^3 - 10x^2 - 350x + 1225 = 0$. Since $x = AD$ is a side length, we know that $x > 0$. We can use synthetic division to find that $x = 5$ is a root of the polynomial.
