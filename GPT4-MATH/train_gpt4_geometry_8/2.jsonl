{"question": "$ABCD$ is a rectangular sheet of paper. $E$ and $F$ are points on $AB$ and $CD$ respectively such that $BE < CF$. If $BCFE$ is folded over $EF$, $C$ maps to $C'$ on $AD$ and $B$ maps to $B'$ such that $\\angle{AB'C'} \\cong \\angle{B'EA}$. If $AB' = 5$ and $BE = 23$, then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed as $a + b\\sqrt{c}$ square units, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are integers and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $a + b + c$.\n", "answer": "Let $\\angle{AB'C'} = \\theta$. By some angle chasing in $\\triangle{AB'E}$, we find that $\\angle{EAB'} = 90^{\\circ} - 2 \\theta$. Before we apply the law of sines, we're going to want to get everything in terms of $\\sin \\theta$, so note that $\\sin \\angle{EAB'} = \\sin(90^{\\circ} - 2 \\theta) = \\cos 2 \\theta = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\theta$. Now, we use law of sines, which gives us the following:\n$\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{5}=\\frac{1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{23} \\implies \\sin \\theta = \\frac{-23 \\pm 27}{20}$, but since $\\theta < 180^{\\circ}$, we go with the positive solution. Thus, $\\sin \\theta = \\frac15$.\nDenote the intersection of $B'C'$ and $AE$ with $G$. By another application of the law of sines, $B'G = \\frac{23}{\\sqrt{24}}$ and $AE = 10\\sqrt{6}$. Since $\\sin \\theta = \\frac15, GE = \\frac{115}{\\sqrt{24}}$, and $AG = AE - GE = 10\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{115}{\\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{24}}$. Note that $\\triangle{EB'G} \\sim \\triangle{C'AG}$, so $\\frac{EG}{B'G}=\\frac{C'G}{AG} \\implies C'G = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{24}}$.\nNow we have that $AB = AE + EB = 10\\sqrt{6} + 23$, and $B'C' = BC = B'G + C'G = \\frac{23}{\\sqrt{24}} + \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{24}}=4\\sqrt{6}$. Thus, the area of $ABCD$ is $(10\\sqrt{6} + 23)(4\\sqrt{6}) = 92\\sqrt{6} + 240$, and our final answer is $92 + 6 + 240 = \\boxed{338}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nWe first draw a diagram of the problem.

Thus, $B'F = 5x$ and $B'C' = 23x$. Similarly, we have $\\triangle B'EA \\sim \\triangle B'CC'$ with a ratio of $5:23$, so $B'E = 5y$ and $B'A = 23y$. Then $B'C' + B'A = BC = 23x + 23y$.\n\nNow, we find $x$ and $y$.

Solving these equations, we get $a=23\\sqrt{2}$ and $b=5\\sqrt{2}$, so the area of $ABCD$ is $a\\cdot b = 115\\sqrt{2}$, and the answer is $115+2=\\boxed{117}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we note that $\\angle{AB'C'} \\cong \\angle{B'EA}$ implies that $\\triangle AB'C' \\sim \\triangle B'EA$.\nLet $x = EC$.

We can use the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle{B'EA}$ and $\\triangle{AB'C'}$ to get that $a^2 + 25 - 10a = 23^2$ and $b^2 + 25 - 10b = (23+a)^2$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives us $b^2 - a^2 = 23^2 - 23^2 - 46a - a^2$, which means that $(b+a)(b-a) = -46a - a^2$. We know that $b > a$, so $b+a > b-a > 0$. Thus, we get that $b+a = 23$ and $b-a = -2a-46$. Solving, we get that $a = 15$ and $b = 8$. Thus, $x = 38$ and $y = 5+8+c$.\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle{B'EA}$ and $\\triangle{AB'C'}$ again to get that $c^2 + 64 - 16c = 23^2$ and $c^2 + 64 - 16c = (23+15)^2$.

Thus, there must be an error in our reasoning.\nGoing back, we see that we incorrectly assumed that $b > a$. However, we only know that $b \\ge a$. Thus, we have that $b = a = 23$ and $c = 0$. This means that $ABCD$ is a square with side length 46, so the area of $ABCD$ is $46^2 = 2116$.
