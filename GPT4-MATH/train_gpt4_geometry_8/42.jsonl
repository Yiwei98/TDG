Since the centers are on the same horizontal level, we can simply find the horizontal distance between them, which is the length of $PU + UV + VQ = 20 + 20 + 110 = 150$.

{"question": "Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12$. A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n", "answer": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$.

When the light reflects off a face, it is as if it passes straight through that face and travels in a straight line until it reaches the vertex diagonally opposite $A$. This is because the path of the light is a straight line in this grid, and the reflections are merely an illusion caused by the walls of the cube. Now, we can easily find the coordinates of this vertex. Since $P$ is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$, it has coordinates $(0, 5, 7)$. The vertex diagonally opposite $A$ is obtained by reflecting the point $(0, 5, 7)$ through the origin, giving us the point $(12, -5, -7)$. The distance between points $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(12, -5, -7)$ is $\\sqrt{12^2 + (-5)^2 + (-7)^2} = \\sqrt{218}$.

The path of the light is a straight line in the plane, so we can find the distance it travels by using the distance formula. The light starts at $(0,0,0)$ and goes through $(12,5,7)$, then through $(12,24,7)$, then through $(0,24,7)$, and finally to $(0,24,0)$. The distance it travels is the sum of the lengths of the segments connecting these points. The length of the first segment is $\\sqrt{(12-0)^2+(5-0)^2+(7-0)^2}=\\sqrt{218}$.

Then the light path is a straight line in this lattice. The problem now becomes finding the distance between the two lattice points $A$ and $A'$. We can find the coordinates of $A'$ by noting that $P$ is 5 units below $B$ and 7 units to the right of $B$. Thus, $A'$ is 5 units above $G$ and 7 units to the right of $G$. So $A'$ has coordinates $(12+7,12-5,12+5)=(19,7,17)$.
