Compute the distance between the centers of these two circles.", "answer": "The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram.  The circle located inside $\\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$.  The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$.  To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula.  The side lengths of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8} = 84. \\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$.  Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right.  It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$. (The reader should confirm this.  Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)  Furthermore, the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ passes through $I$ and $E$, and the radii $\\overline{SI}$ and $\\overline{TE}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{AC}$, so triangles $\\triangle ASI$ and $\\triangle ATE$ are similar right triangles.  By the Pythagorean Theorem we compute \\[ AI = \\sqrt{(AS)^2+(SI)^2} = \\sqrt{36+16}=2\\sqrt{13}. \\]Using the similar triangles we find that $AI/AE = AS/AT = 6/21 = 2/7$.
