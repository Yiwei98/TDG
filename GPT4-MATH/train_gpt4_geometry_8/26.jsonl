Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits.

So, the area of parallelogram $ABCD$ is $\\frac{32}{5} + 8 = \\frac{72}{5}$.\n\nNow, we find the height of parallelogram $ABCD$. We use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, $A = bh$. We have $AB = \\frac{1}{4}(8) = 2$ and $A = \\frac{72}{5}$, so the height of parallelogram $ABCD$ is $h = \\frac{A}{b} = \\frac{\\frac{72}{5}}{2} = \\frac{36}{5}$.\n\nFinally, we find $FC$. We use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $CDF$. We have $DC = 7$, $DF = 8 - 2 = 6$, and $CF = h = \\frac{36}{5}$. So, $FC^2 = DC^2 - DF^2 = 7^2 - 6^2 = 49 - 36 = 13$. It follows that $FC = \\sqrt{13} \\approx \\boxed{3.6}$.\nThe answer is 3.6", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the length of $AD$.\nSince $AB = \\frac{1}{4}AD$ and $AB = 8$, we have $AD = 32$.\nNow, we find the length of $AE$.\nSince $ED = \\frac{4}{5}AD$ and $AD = 32$, we have $ED = \\frac{4}{5}(32) = 25.6$.\nTherefore, $AE = AD - ED = 32 - 25.6 = 6.4$.\nNext, we find the length of $DE$.\nSince $DC = 7$ and $AE = 6.4$, we have $DE = DC - AE = 7 - 6.4 = 0.6$.\nNow, we have a right triangle $DEG$ with legs $DE = 0.6$ and $EG = 4$.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we find the length of $DG$.\n$$DG^2 = DE^2 + EG^2 = 0.6^2 + 4^2 = 16.36$$\nSo, $DG = \\sqrt{16.36} = 4.04$.\nFinally, we find the length of $FC$.\nSince $DG = 4.04$ and $CG = 8$, we have $FC = FG - CG = 4.04 - 8 = \\boxed{-3.96}$.\nThe answer is -3.96.", "Let's think step by step\nWe have that $AB = \\frac{1}{4}AD$ and $ED = \\frac{4}{5}AD$, so $AB + BG = \\frac{1}{4}AD + \\frac{4}{5}AD = \\frac{9}{20}AD$. Since $AB + BG = AG$, we have $AG = \\frac{9}{20}AD$.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $ADC$, we have $AC^2 = AD^2 - DC^2 = AD^2 - 49$. Similarly, by the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $ABC$, we have $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 + 64$.\nNow we can set these equal to each other: $AD^2 - 49 = AB^2 + 64$. Since $AB = \\frac{1}{4}AD$, we can substitute and get $AD^2 - 49 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}AD\\right)^2 + 64$.

Since $AE=6.4$, $EF=10.4-6.4=4$.
