Now, we can turn our attention to the five sided figure that contains angles $A$, $B$, and $x$.  By vertical angles the right most angle will be $116-y$ degrees.  The angle with exterior measure of $x$ degrees will have an interior measure of $360-x$ degrees.  Finally, the sum of the angles in a five sided polygon will be equal to $(5-2)180=540$ degrees.  So, we can write $$A+B+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$28+74+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$\\boxed{128}=x+y$$", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nThe sum of the angles in triangle $ABC$ is $180^{\\circ}$,\nso $m\\angle A+m\\angle B+m\\angle C=28^{\\circ}+74^{\\circ}+26^{\\circ}=128^{\\circ}$.\nSince the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is $360^{\\circ}$,\nthe sum of the angles in quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $360^{\\circ}-128^{\\circ}=232^{\\circ}$.\nThus, $x+y=232^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}=\\boxed{52^{\\circ}}$.\nThe answer is 52^{\\circ}", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find that $m\\angle ACD = 180^\\circ - m\\angle AC = 180^\\circ - 26^\\circ = 154^\\circ$.\nNext, we find that $m\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - m\\angle BC = 180^\\circ - 74^\\circ = 106^\\circ$.\nNow, we find that $m\\angle ADC = 180^\\circ - m\\angle A - m\\angle ACD = 180^\\circ - 28^\\circ - 154^\\circ = -2^\\circ$.\nSince the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we find that $m\\angle x = 180^\\circ - m\\angle ADC - m\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - (-2^\\circ) - 106^\\circ = 76^\\circ$.\nFinally, we find that $m\\angle y = 180^\\circ - m\\angle A - m\\angle x = 180^\\circ - 28^\\circ - 76^\\circ = 76^\\circ$.\nThus, $x+y = 76^\\circ + 76^\\circ = \\boxed{152^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is 152^{\\circ}.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first find the measure of the angle marked $y$ in the triangle.\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$,\nwe have $180 - 26 - 74 = 80^\\circ$ for the measure of that angle.\nThus, $y = 180 - 80 = 100^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we find the measure of the angle marked $x$ in the triangle.\nWe have $180 - 28 - 74 = 78^\\circ$ for the measure of that angle.\nThus, $x = 180 - 78 = 102^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, we find $x+y = 100+102 = \\boxed{202}$.\nThe answer is 202.", "Let's think step by step\nSince $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$ are alternate interior angles, we have $m\\angle A = x = 28^\\circ$.\nNext, we note that $\\angle C$ and $\\angle y$ are corresponding angles, so $m\\angle C = y = 26^\\circ$.\nTherefore, $x+y = 28^\\circ + 26^\\circ = \\boxed{54^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is 54^{\\circ}", "Let's think step by step\nWe can find the value of $x$ by noting that the sum of the angles of triangle $ABx$ is $180^\\circ$.\nSo, $x = 180^\\circ - 28^\\circ - 74^\\circ = 78^\\circ$.\nSimilarly, we can find the value of $y$ by noting that the sum of the angles of triangle $CyB$ is $180^\\circ$.\nSo, $y = 180^\\circ - 26^\\circ - 74^\\circ = 80^\\circ$.\nTherefore, $x + y = 78^\\circ + 80^\\circ = \\boxed{158^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is 158^{\\circ}", "Let's think step by step\nSince $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$ are alternate interior angles, we have $m\\angle A = x = 28^\\circ$.\nSimilarly, since $\\angle C$ and the angle at the bottom right corner of the figure are alternate interior angles, we have $m\\angle C = y = 26^\\circ$.\nTherefore, $x + y = 28^\\circ + 26^\\circ = \\boxed{54^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is 54^\\circ", "Let's think step by step\nWe first find the measure of the angle between $x$ and $y$.\nThis angle is supplementary to the sum of the angles at $A$, $B$, and $C$,\nso it measures $180^\\circ - 28^\\circ - 74^\\circ - 26^\\circ = 52^\\circ$.\nNow, we notice that the sum of the angles in the quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$,\nso $x+y = 360^\\circ - 52^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = \\boxed{128^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is 128^{\\circ}", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the measure of the angle of the triangle formed by $x$, $y$, and the right angle between the horizontal and vertical lines.\nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so the measure of the angle in that triangle is $180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.\nNow, we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$ for each of the three triangles formed by the horizontal and vertical lines and the given angles.\nFor triangle $A$, the sum of the angles is $90^\\circ + 28^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ$, which gives us $x = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 28^\\circ = 62^\\circ$.\nSimilarly, for triangle $C$, we have $90^\\circ + 26^\\circ + y = 180^\\circ$, which gives us $y = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 26^\\circ = 64^\\circ$.\nFinally, we find the sum of $x$ and $y$: $x + y = 62^\\circ + 64^\\circ = \\boxed{126^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is 126^\\circ"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}
