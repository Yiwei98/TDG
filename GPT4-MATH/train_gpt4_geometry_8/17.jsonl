Thus, $\\frac{BM}{BN} = \\frac{CM}{CN} = \\frac{MP}{NP} = \\frac{35}{25} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Let $BM = 7k$ and $BN = 5k$. Then, $CM = \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot CN$. By Law of Cosines on $\\triangle{ABC}$, we have $AB^2 = (7k)^2 + (5k)^2 - 2 \\cdot 7k \\cdot 5k \\cos{A}$ and $AC^2 = (\\frac{7}{5} \\cdot CN)^2 + CN^2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot CN^2 \\cos{A}$.

We are given that $MP = 35$ and $NP = 25$, so $MN = 60$. By Law of Cosines on $\\triangle{MNP}$, we have $60^2 = 35^2 + 25^2 - 2 \\cdot 35 \\cdot 25 \\cos{\\angle{MNP}}$.

Similarly, by Power of a Point Theorem applied to point $Q$, we have $QY\\cdot XY = XQ\\cdot YQ$, so $15\\cdot XY = (25+XQ)(10+XQ)$. Dividing the two equations, we get $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10+XQ}{15-XQ}$, and solving for $XQ$, we find $XQ=5$. Then, $XY = 45$.\nNow, let $O$ be the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$. By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, $\\angle A = \\angle XOY$. Also, $\\angle XOP = \\angle XOQ = 90^\\circ$, so quadrilateral $XOPY$ is cyclic. Thus, by Ptolemy's Theorem on $XOPY$, we get $OP\\cdot YQ + OQ\\cdot PX = OY\\cdot PQ$. Let $a = BC, b = AC, c = AB$, and $R$ be the circumradius of $\\triangle ABC$. Then, we have $\\frac{a}{2}\\cdot R\\cdot\\frac{c}{2} + \\frac{a}{2}\\cdot R\\cdot\\frac{b}{2} = R\\cdot 25\\cdot\\frac{a}{2}$. Thus, $ab+ac = 25a$, so $a(b+c) = 25a$. Since $a \\neq 0$, we have $b+c=25$. By the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABC$, we have $a^2 = b^2+c^2-2bc\\cos A$. Now, $\\cos A = \\cos\\angle XOY = \\frac{45^2 - 10^2 - 15^2}{2\\cdot 10\\cdot 15} = \\frac{3}{5}$. Thus, $a^2 = b^2+c^2 - \\frac{6bc}{5}$. Since $a^2+b^2-2bc\\cos A = c^2$, we have $a^2 = c^2 - \\frac{6bc}{5}$. Adding the two equations, we get $2a^2 = b^2+c^2 - \\frac{6bc}{5} +c^2 - \\frac{6bc}{5} = (b+c)^2 - 2bc - \\frac{12bc}{5} = 25^2 - \\frac{22bc}{5}$. It follows that $5a^2 = 625 - 22bc$. From $a^2 = c^2 - \\frac{6bc}{5}$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + \\frac{6bc}{5}$. Substituting $a^2 = \\frac{625 - 22bc}{5}$, we get $c^2 = \\frac{625 - 16bc}{5}$. Since $c^2$ is an integer, $5$ must divide $625 - 16bc$, so $625 - 16bc = 5k$ for some integer $k$. Then, $16bc = 625 - 5k = 5(125-k)$, so $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2n+1$ for some integer $n$. Then, we have $16bc = 5(124-2n) = 20(62-n)$. Since $16$ divides $20(62-n)$, $16$ must divide $62-n$. Let $62-n = 16m$ for some integer $m$. Then, $n = 62 - 16m$. Substituting $k=2n+1$ and solving for $bc$, we find $bc = 155 - 20m$. Now, substituting $n = 62 - 16m$ and solving for $a^2$, we find $a^2 = 80m^2 - 1240m + 1925$. Since $a^2$ is a perfect square, we must have $80m^2 - 1240m + 1925 = (20m-a)(20m+a)$. Thus, $20m-a$ and $20m+a$ are both factors of $1925$. We find that $1925 = 5^2\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, so the only possible values of $20m-a$ and $20m+a$ are $1$ and $1925$, and $5$ and $385$. If $20m-a = 1$ and $20m+a = 1925$, we get $m = 48$ and $a = 959$. However, this gives $b+c = 25$, which is impossible since $a < b+c$. Thus, we must have $20m-a = 5$ and $20m+a = 385$. This gives $m = 10$ and $a = 195$. Then, we have $bc = 155 - 20m = 35$, so $AB\\cdot AC = 35$.
