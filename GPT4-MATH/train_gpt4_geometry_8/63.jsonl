{"question": "Euler's formula states that for a convex polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V-E+F=2$. A particular convex polyhedron has 32 faces, each of which is either a triangle or a pentagon. At each of its $V$ vertices, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet. What is the value of $100P+10T+V$?\n", "answer": "The convex polyhedron of the problem can be easily visualized; it corresponds to a dodecahedron (a regular solid with $12$ equilateral pentagons) in which the $20$ vertices have all been truncated to form $20$ equilateral triangles with common vertices. The resulting solid has then $p=12$ smaller equilateral pentagons and $t=20$ equilateral triangles yielding a total of $t+p=F=32$ faces. In each vertex, $T=2$ triangles and $P=2$ pentagons are concurrent. Now, the number of edges $E$ can be obtained if we count the number of sides that each triangle and pentagon contributes: $E=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$, (the factor $2$ in the denominator is because we are counting twice each edge, since two adjacent faces share one edge). Thus, $E=60$. Finally, using Euler's formula we have $V=E-30=30$.\nIn summary, the solution to the problem is $100P+10T+V=\\boxed{250}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nLet $F_t$ be the number of triangular faces and $F_p$ the number of pentagonal faces.

Substituting the expressions we found for $V$, $E$, and $F$, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{3}F_t + \\frac{1}{5}F_p - \\frac{1}{2}(3F_t + 5F_p) + F_t + F_p = 2.\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{6}F_t - \\frac{1}{10}F_p = 2.\\]\n\nSince $F_t + F_p = 32$, we can solve for $F_t$ in terms of $F_p$:\n\n\\[F_t = 32 - F_p.\\]\n\nNow substitute this expression for $F_t$ into the equation $\\frac{1}{6}F_t - \\frac{1}{10}F_p = 2$:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{6}(32 - F_p) - \\frac{1}{10}F_p = 2.\\]\n\nSolving for $F_p$, we get $F_p = 20$.

Since $V = 2p - 28$, we have $100P + 10T + V = 100P + 10(32 - p) + (2p - 28) = 100P + 320 - 10p + 2p - 28 = 92P + 292$. Thus, we want to find the value of $92P + 292$.\n\nSince $t + p = 32$, we know that $32 - p$ triangles and $p$ pentagons meet at each vertex. Thus, $T = 32 - p$ and $P = p$. Substituting these values into the equation $3T + 5P = 2E$, we get $3(32 - p) + 5p = 2E$. This simplifies to $96 - 3p + 5p = 2E$, so $2p = 2E - 96$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $p = E - 48$.\n\nNow we can substitute this value of $p$ into the expression for $92P + 292$. We get $92(E - 48) + 292 = 92E - 4416 + 292 = 92E - 4124$.

Then $V = V_t + V_p$.\n\nNow, we count the number of edges in two ways. Each triangle contributes 3 edges, and each pentagon contributes 5 edges. However, each edge is shared by two faces, so the total number of edges is $E = \\frac{3F_t + 5F_p}{2}$. On the other hand, at each vertex where three triangles meet, there are 3 edges, and at each vertex where two pentagons meet, there are 5 edges.

However, each edge is shared by two faces, so $E=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$.\n\nNow, let $v_t$ be the number of vertices where $T$ triangles and $P$ pentagons meet. Then, the total number of vertices is $V=v_1+v_2+\\dots+v_t$. Each such vertex is shared by $T$ triangles and $P$ pentagons, so it contributes $T+P$ edges. Thus, the total number of edges can also be expressed as $E=(T+P)(v_1+v_2+\\dots+v_t)=(T+P)V$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $E$, we have $(T+P)V=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$.

Simplifying, we get $2(T+P)(3t+5p)=3t+5p$.\n\nSince $3t+5p$ is not zero (otherwise, there would be no edges), we can divide both sides by $3t+5p$ to get $2(T+P)=1$. Since $T$ and $P$ are both integers, the only possibility is $T=0$ and $P=1$. This means that at each vertex, one triangular face and one pentagonal face meet.\n\nNow, let's count the number of vertices $V$. Each triangular face has 3 vertices, and there are $t$ triangular faces, so there are $3t$ \"vertex contributions\" from the triangular faces. Each pentagonal face has 5 vertices, and there are $p$ pentagonal faces, so there are $5p$ \"vertex contributions\" from the pentagonal faces. However, we have counted each vertex twice (once for the triangular face and once for the pentagonal face that meet at the vertex), so the total number of vertices is $V=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$.\n\nSince $t+p=32$, we have $p=32-t$. Substituting this into the expression for $V$, we get $V=\\frac{3t+5(32-t)}{2}=\\frac{160-t}{2}$. Since $V$ is an integer, $t$ must be even. Trying $t=30$, we get $V=65$, which is too many vertices for 32 faces. Trying $t=28$, we get $V=61$, which works.\n\nSo we have $t=28$, $p=4$, and $V=61$. Then $100P+10T+V=100(1)+10(0)+61=\\boxed{161}$.\nThe answer is 161", "Let's think step by step\nSince there are 32 faces and each face is either a triangle or a pentagon, let $t$ be the number of triangular faces and $p$ be the number of pentagonal faces.

However, since each edge is shared by two faces, we must divide the total by 2 to avoid double-counting. So, we have $E = \\frac{3t + 5p}{2}$.\n\nNext, we count the vertices. At each vertex, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet. Thus, there are $3T$ edges coming from the triangular faces and $5P$ edges coming from the pentagonal faces. Since each edge connects two vertices, we have $V = \\frac{3T + 5P}{2}$.\n\nNow, we use Euler's formula: $V - E + F = 2$.

Substituting $T - t = 4$ and $P - p = 2$ into this expression, we get:\n\n$V = \\frac{3(4) + 5(2)}{2} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11$\n\nThus, the value of $100P + 10T + V = 240 + V = \\boxed{251}$.\nThe answer is 251", "Let's think step by step\nLet $t$ be the number of triangular faces and $p$ be the number of pentagonal faces.

We have three equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nt+p &= 32, \\\\\n3t+5p &= 2E, \\\\\n3T+5P &= 3V.\n\\end{align*}\nDividing the third equation by 3, we get $T+5P/3=V$. Now, at every vertex, $T$ triangles and $P$ pentagons meet, so there are $T+P$ vertices per vertex. Thus, $V=(T+P)k$ for some positive integer $k$. Substituting $V$ into the fourth equation, we get $T+5P/3=(T+P)k$. Dividing both sides by $T+P$, we get $k=\\frac{1+5P/3T}{3}$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, $5P/3T$ must be an integer. The smallest possible value for $P$ is 3, which makes $5P/3T=5$. Thus, $k=2$, and there are 2 vertices for every combination of $T$ triangles and $P$ pentagons.\n\nNow, we have $V=2(T+P)$. Substituting this into Euler's formula, we get $2(T+P)-E+32=2$. Since $3t+5p=2E$, we have $2(3t+5p)-E+64=4$. Adding these equations, we get $E+64=4$, so $E=60$. Substituting this back into the second equation, we get $3t+5p=120$, or $t+5p=40$. Since $t+p=32$, we have $p=8$ and $t=24$. Thus, there are 8 pentagonal faces and 24 triangular faces.\n\nNow, we find the number of vertices. Since there are 8 pentagonal faces and 24 triangular faces, we have $3T+5P=3V$. Substituting the values of $T$ and $P$, we get $3(24)+5(8)=3V$, so $V=40$.
