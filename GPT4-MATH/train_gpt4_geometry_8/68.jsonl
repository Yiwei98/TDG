Since $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are right angles, we have two Pythagorean triples: $a^2 + b^2 = 9$ and $(3 - b)^2 + a^2 = 9$. The first equation gives us $a^2 = 9 - b^2$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $(3 - b)^2 + 9 - b^2 = 9$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 6b + 9 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(b - 3)^2 = 0$, so $b = 3$.

Since quadrilateral $ABCD$ has right angles at $B$ and $D$, we know that $\\angle ADC$ is also a right angle. Therefore, we should have used the Pythagorean triple $a^2 + (3 - b)^2 = 9$. Solving for $a^2$, we get $a^2 = 9 - (3 - b)^2$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $9 - (3 - b)^2 + b^2 = 9$. This simplifies to $(3 - b)^2 = 0$, so $b = 3$.

However, we are given that the two sides have distinct integer lengths, so this solution is not valid either.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possibilities for the Pythagorean triples, we conclude that quadrilateral $ABCD$ must have non-integer side lengths. Let $x = AB$ and $y = BC$. Then $x^2 + y^2 = 9$ and $(3 - y)^2 + x^2 = 9$. Solving for $x^2$, we get $x^2 = 9 - y^2$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $(3 - y)^2 + 9 - y^2 = 9$. This simplifies to $y^2 - 6y + 9 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(y - 3)^2 = 0$, so $y = 3$. Then $x^2 = 9 - y^2 = 0$, so $x = 0$.
