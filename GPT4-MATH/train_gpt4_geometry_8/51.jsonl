Let $F = (0, y)$ be the $y$-intercept of line $CD$.\n\nSince $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ are radii and $\\overline{CD}$ is tangent to both circles, we have $\\angle ACD = \\angle BDE = 90^\\circ$. Thus, $\\angle ACB = \\angle DCB = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ$. Since $\\angle ACB = \\angle DCB$, triangles $ACD$ and $BDC$ are similar.\n\nSince $AC = 2$ and $BD = 1$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is 2. In particular, $DE = 2 \\cdot CE$. Since $AB = 3$, we have $AE = 2$ and $BE = 1$. Thus, $CE = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $DE = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ACD$ to find $CD$. We have $AD = AC + CD + DB = 2 + CD + 1 = CD + 3$, so $CD^2 = AD^2 - AC^2 = (CD + 3)^2 - 2^2$. Expanding, we get $CD^2 = CD^2 + 6CD + 9 - 4$, so $6CD = 5$ and $CD = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nFinally, we use similar triangles to find $CF$. Since $CD = \\frac{5}{6}$, we have $CF = \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{18}$. Thus, the $y$-intercept of the line is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}
