The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe use mass points. Assign a mass of 3 to $D$ and a mass of 1 to $B$. Then $C$ has mass 4. Assign a mass of 2 to $E$ and a mass of 3 to $A$. Then $B$ has mass 5. Since $D$ and $E$ have masses in the ratio $3:2$, $P$ divides $CE$ in the ratio $3:2$. Thus, $\\frac{CP}{PE} = \\boxed{3}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use mass points. Assign a mass of $1$ at point $D$, which gives a mass of $3$ at point $C$. Assign a mass of $2$ at point $E$, which gives a mass of $3$ at point $A$. Then, the mass at point $B$ is $5$.\n\nSince the ratio of $AE$ to $EB$ is $3:2$, the ratio of $AP$ to $PB$ is also $3:2$.
