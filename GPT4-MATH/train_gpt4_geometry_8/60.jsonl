{"question": "A solid in the shape of a right circular cone is 4 inches tall and its base has a 3-inch radius. The entire surface of the cone, including its base, is painted. A plane parallel to the base of the cone divides the cone into two solids, a smaller cone-shaped solid $C$ and a frustum-shaped solid $F,$ in such a way that the ratio between the areas of the painted surfaces of $C$ and $F$ and the ratio between the volumes of $C$ and $F$ are both equal to $k$. Given that $k=\\frac m n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$\n", "answer": "Our original solid has volume equal to $V = \\frac13 \\pi r^2 h = \\frac13 \\pi 3^2\\cdot 4 = 12 \\pi$ and has surface area $A = \\pi r^2 + \\pi r \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the slant height of the cone. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get $\\ell = 5$ and $A = 24\\pi$.\nLet $x$ denote the radius of the small cone. Let $A_c$ and $A_f$ denote the area of the painted surface on cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively, and let $V_c$ and $V_f$ denote the volume of cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively. Because the plane cut is parallel to the base of our solid, $C$ is similar to the uncut solid and so the height and slant height of cone $C$ are $\\frac{4}{3}x$ and $\\frac{5}{3}x$, respectively.
