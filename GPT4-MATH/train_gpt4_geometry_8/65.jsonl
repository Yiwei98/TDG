{"question": "A fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?", "answer": "The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet.

We know that AD = 80 ft.\n\nSince the fly passes through the center of the circle in the first part of the journey, AB = BC = 58 ft (the radius of the circle).\n\nNow we have a triangle ABC with AB = BC = 58 ft. Since the fly travels in a straight line from B to C, angle ABC is a straight angle, or 180 degrees.\n\nNext, we consider triangle ACD. We know that AD = 80 ft, and CD = 58 ft (the radius of the circle). Since angle ACD is also a straight angle, angle ADC is supplementary to angle ABC, so angle ADC is also 180 degrees.\n\nNow we have triangle ACD with AD = 80 ft, CD = 58 ft, and angle ADC = 180 degrees. We can use the Law of Cosines to find AC:\n\nAC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 - 2(AD)(CD)cos(180)\nAC^2 = 80^2 + 58^2 - 2(80)(58)(-1)\nAC^2 = 6400 + 3364 + 9280\nAC^2 = 19044\nAC = sqrt(19044) = 138 ft\n\nSo the total distance the fly traveled is AB + BC + AC = 58 + 58 + 138 = 254 ft.\n\nThe answer is 254 feet.", "Let's think step by step\nLet A, B, C, and D be the starting point, the point opposite the starting point, the third point, and the center of the circle, respectively.\nSince the fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle, the distance of the first part of the journey is the diameter of the circle, which is 2 * 58 = 116 feet.\nNow, let's consider the triangle ACD. Since AD is the radius of the circle, AD = 58 feet. The third part of the journey was 80 feet long, so AC = 80 feet. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have CD^2 = AC^2 - AD^2 = 80^2 - 58^2 = 2304. Taking the square root, we get CD = 48 feet.\nNow, let's consider the triangle BCD. Since BD is also the radius of the circle, BD = 58 feet. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have BC^2 = BD^2 - CD^2 = 58^2 - 48^2 = 676. Taking the square root, we get BC = 26 feet.\nThus, the total distance the fly traveled is 116 (first part) + 26 (second part) + 80 (third part) = 222 feet.\nThe answer is 222 feet.", "Let's think step by step\nLet A, B, C, and D be the starting point, the point opposite the starting point, the third point, and the center of the circle, respectively.\nFirst, the fly walks from A to B through the center D. Since the radius is 58 feet, the distance from A to D is 58 feet, and the distance from D to B is also 58 feet. So the first part of the journey is 58 + 58 = 116 feet long.\nNext, the fly walks from B to C. Let E be the point on the circle such that DE is perpendicular to BC. Then, triangle DEC is a right triangle with DE = 58 feet and DC = 29 feet (half the diameter). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have EC = sqrt(58^2 - 29^2) = sqrt(5041) = 71 feet. So the second part of the journey is 71 feet long.\nFinally, the third part of the journey is from C to A, which is given as 80 feet long.\nThus, the total distance the fly traveled is 116 + 71 + 80 = 267 feet.\nThe answer is 267 feet.", "Let's think step by step\nLet A, B, and C be the starting point, the point opposite the starting point, and the point the fly walks to after going through the center, respectively. Let O be the center of the circle. Let D be the point on the circle where the fly starts and ends its journey.\n\nSince the fly walks through the center of the circle, AB = 2 * 58 = 116 feet (twice the radius).\nSince the fly walks 80 feet from point C back to point A, AC = 80 feet.\nWe are given that the fly walks along the edge of the circle from B to C. So, the angle BOC is half of angle BAC. Let's call this angle x.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines on triangle AOC, we can find angle AOC:\ncos(AOC) = (AC^2 + OC^2 - AO^2) / (2 * AC * OC) = (80^2 + 58^2 - 58^2) / (2 * 80 * 58) = 0.5\nSo, angle AOC = 60 degrees.\n\nSince angle BOC is half of angle AOC, angle BOC = x = 30 degrees.\n\nNow we can find the length of BC using the arc length formula:\nArc length = radius * angle (in radians)\nBC = 58 * (30 * pi/180) = 58 * pi/6\n\nThe total distance the fly traveled is AB + BC + AC = 116 + 58 * pi/6 + 80.\nThe answer is 116+58\\pi/6+80.", "Let's think step by step\nLet A be the starting point, B be the center of the circle, C be the point where the fly reaches after walking straight across the ceiling, D be the point where the fly reaches after the second part, and E be the point where the fly reaches after the third part, which is the starting point A.\n\nSince the fly walks straight across the ceiling through the center of the circle, AC = BC = 58 feet (radius of the circle). Therefore, AB = 2 * 58 = 116 feet.\n\nNow, we know that the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, so AE = 80 feet.\n\nWe are given that the fly does not walk back through the center in the second part of the journey. Therefore, the only way for the fly to travel from C to D and then to E (the starting point) is to form a triangle CDE with CD and DE as the legs and CE as the hypotenuse. Since CE is the diameter of the circle, CE = 2 * 58 = 116 feet.\n\nNow, we have a triangle CDE with CE = 116 feet and DE = 80 feet. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of CD.\n\nCD^2 + DE^2 = CE^2\nCD^2 + 80^2 = 116^2\nCD^2 = 116^2 - 80^2\nCD^2 = 13456 - 6400\nCD^2 = 7056\nCD = \u221a7056 = 84 feet\n\nNow, we have the lengths of all three parts of the journey: AB = 116 feet, CD = 84 feet, and AE = 80 feet. Adding these lengths together, we find the total distance the fly traveled:\n\nTotal distance = AB + CD + AE = 116 + 84 + 80 = 280 feet\n\nThe fly traveled a total of 280 feet over the course of all three parts. The answer is 280.", "Let's think step by step\nLet A, B, C, and D be the starting point, the point opposite the starting point on the edge of the circle, the third point on the edge of the circle, and the center of the circle, respectively.\nSince the fly travels through the center of the circle in the first part of the journey, the length of the first part is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2 * 58 = 116 feet.\nIn the second part of the journey, the fly travels from point B to point C. Let's call the length of this part of the journey x feet. \nWe know that the third part of the journey is 80 feet long.\nNow, let's consider triangle ADC. Since AD and DC are both radii of the circle, they have the same length of 58 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of AC: AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2 - 2(AD)(DC)cos(DAC) = 58^2 + 58^2 - 2(58)(58)cos(DAC). Since angle DAC is a straight angle, cos(DAC) = -1. Therefore, AC^2 = 58^2 + 58^2 + 2(58)(58) = 4(58^2), and AC = 2(58) = 116 feet.\nNow, let's consider triangle ABC. We know that AC = 116 feet, AB = 116 feet, and BC = x feet. Using the Law of Cosines, we can find the angle ABC: cos(ABC) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2(AB)(BC)) = (116^2 + x^2 - 116^2) / (2(116)(x)).\nSince the third part of the journey is 80 feet long and the fly returns to its starting point, we know that angle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC = 80 feet. Using the Law of Cosines again, we can find the angle ABC: cos(ABC) = (80^2 + 80^2 - 116^2) / (2(80)(80)) = -7/8.\nNow we have two expressions for cos(ABC): -7/8 and (x^2) / (2(116)(x)). Equating these expressions and solving for x, we get x^2 = (2(116)(x))(-7/8), x^2 = -203(x), x = -203 feet. Since the length of the journey cannot be negative, we discard this solution.\nTherefore, the total distance traveled by the fly is 116 + 116 + 80 = 312 feet.\nThe answer is 312.", "Let's think step by step\nLet A, B, and C be the starting point, the opposite edge, and the third point on the edge of the circle, respectively. Let O be the center of the circle. Then, triangle AOC is isosceles with AO = CO = 58 feet, and AC = 80 feet.\n\nFirst, the fly walks from A to B through the center O. Since the room is circular with a radius of 58 feet, the distance from A to O is 58 feet, and the distance from O to B is also 58 feet. So, the total distance of the first part is 58 + 58 = 116 feet.\n\nNext, the fly walks from B to C. Since B is the opposite edge of the circle, the angle AOC is a straight angle, which means angle BOC is half of angle AOC. Therefore, triangle BOC is also isosceles with BO = CO = 58 feet. Using the Law of Cosines in triangle BOC, we can find the length of BC:\n\nBC^2 = BO^2 + CO^2 - 2(BO)(CO)cos(BOC)\nBC^2 = 58^2 + 58^2 - 2(58)(58)cos(180/2)\nBC^2 = 2(58)^2(1 + cos(90))\nBC^2 = 2(58)^2(1)\nBC = sqrt(2(58)^2) = 58\u221a2\n\nSo, the total distance of the second part is 58\u221a2 feet.\n\nFinally, the fly walks from C to A, which is the third part of the journey with a distance of 80 feet.\n\nAdding all three parts together, the total distance the fly traveled is 116 + 58\u221a2 + 80 = 196 + 58\u221a2 feet.", "Let's think step by step\nLabel the points A, B, C, and D, where A is the starting point, B is the opposite edge of the circle, C is the other point on the edge, and D is the center of the circle.\nThe fly travels from A to B, then B to C, and finally C to A.\nSince AB passes through the center of the circle, AB is the diameter of the circle, so AB = 2*(radius) = 2*58 = 116 feet.\nWe are given that CA = 80 feet.\nLet's consider triangle ABC. Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (because an inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is always 90 degrees).\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC.\nBC^2 = AB^2 - AC^2 = 116^2 - 80^2 = 1936.\nTherefore, BC = sqrt(1936) = 44 feet.\nSo, the total distance the fly traveled is AB + BC + CA = 116 + 44 + 80 = \\boxed{240} feet.\nThe answer is 240"], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Geometry"}
