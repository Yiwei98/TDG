The midpoint of segment $AB$ is $M=(5,0)$.

Since $AB = 10$, we have $AD = DB = 5$. Also, let $E$ be the point on $AB$ such that $CE$ is an altitude of the triangle. Then, we have $\\triangle CDE \\sim \\triangle CAB$ by AA Similarity (both are right triangles and they share angle $C$). \n\nTo find the ratio of similitude, we can use the fact that $DE$ is half of $CB$. Thus, $DE = 4$, and the ratio of similitude is $\\frac{DE}{CB} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nNow, we can find the length of $CE$ by using the ratio of similitude and the fact that $CE$ corresponds to $CA$ in the similar triangles. We have $CE = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CA = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 = 3$. \n\nFinally, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $CDE$ to find $CD$.

Since triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC = 6$ and $BC = 8$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $CD$. We have $CD^2 = AC^2 - AD^2 = 6^2 - 5^2 = 11$, so $CD = \\sqrt{11}$.\n\nNow, let's consider right triangle $CMD$. We have $MD = 5 - AD = 5 - 5 = 0$, so $MD = 0$.

Since $M$ is the midpoint, $AM = MB = 5$.\n\nNow, let's draw the altitude from $C$ to side $AB$ and label the intersection point as $D$. Triangle $ACD$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ by AA similarity (both are right triangles and they share angle $A$). The ratio of corresponding side lengths in these similar triangles is $CD/AC = AC/AB$, so $CD = AC^2/AB = (6^2)/10 = 36/10 = 18/5$.\n\nWe now have right triangle $CMD$ with right angle at $D$, and we know $CD = 18/5$ and $MD = AM - AD = 5 - (AC/2) = 5 - (6/2) = 2$.

The first inequality simplifies to $x > 15$. The second and third inequalities are always true since $x > 0$. So, the only restriction on $x$ is that $x > 15$.\n\nNow, consider $\\triangle ABD$. By the Triangle Inequality, we have $9 + x > x$, which is always true, $x + x > 21$, which simplifies to $x > 10.5$, and $9 + 21 > x$, which simplifies to $x < 30$. Combining these inequalities with $x > 15$, we have $15 < x < 30$.\n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the possible values of $x$ are $16, 17, 18, \\ldots, 29$. There are 14 possible values for $x$. For each value of $x$, the perimeter of $\\triangle ACD$ is $30 + x + x = 30 + 2x$. The sum of all possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$ is $s = 14(30) + 2(16 + 17 + \\cdots + 29) = 14(30) + 2\\left(\\frac{16 + 29}{2} \\cdot 14\\right) = 14(30 + 45) = \\boxed{1050}$.\n\nThe answer is 1050.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $x = AD = CD$. Then by the Triangle Inequality on triangle $ABD$, we have $x + 9 > BD \\Longrightarrow BD > x - 9$. Similarly, by the Triangle Inequality on triangle $CBD$, we have $x + 21 > BD \\Longrightarrow BD > x + 12$. Thus, $x + 12 > x - 9 \\Longrightarrow x > 10.5$. Since $x$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $x$ is 11. Also, note that if $x = 11$, then $BD = 22 - 9 = 13$, which is an integer. Thus, we have found one possible value for $x$. Now, let's see if we can find any more.\n\nSuppose there exists another possible value for $x$, say $x = k > 11$. Then we have $BD > k - 9$ and $BD > k + 12$. Thus, $k - 9 > k + 12 \\Longrightarrow k > 21$. However, if $k > 21$, then $BD > k - 9 > 21 - 9 = 12$, which contradicts the fact that $BD > k + 12 > 21 + 12 = 33$. Thus, we have a contradiction, so there are no other possible values for $x$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for $x$ is 11, in which case $BD = 13$ and the perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $11 + 11 + 30 = 52$.

This is an integer, so this case is valid.\n\nCase 2: $x = 14$. In this case, we have $BD = 9$ by the Law of Cosines. This is an integer, so this case is also valid.\n\nCase 3: $x = 15$. In this case, we have $BD = 12$ by the Law of Cosines. This is an integer, so this case is also valid.\n\nCase 4: $x = 16$. In this case, we have $BD = 15$ by the Law of Cosines. This is an integer, so this case is also valid.\n\nCase 5: $x = 17$. In this case, we have $BD = 18$ by the Law of Cosines. This is an integer, so this case is also valid.\n\nCase 6: $x = 18$. In this case, we have $BD = 21$ by the Law of Cosines. However, this is not a valid case because $D$ would lie on $\\overline{AC}$.\n\nThus, the only valid cases are when $x = 13, 14, 15, 16, 17$.
