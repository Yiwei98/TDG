Then we know that $4(a+b+c) = 140$ and $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2} = 21$. Dividing the first equation by 4, we get $a+b+c = 35$. Now, we square the equation with the square root to get rid of the square root: $a^2+b^2+c^2 = 441$. \n\nNow consider the total surface area of the box, which is $2(ab+bc+ac)$. We want to find this value. We can rewrite this expression as $2(ab+bc+ac) = 2(a(b+c) + bc) = 2a(b+c) + 2bc$. Since we know $a+b+c = 35$, we have $a = 35 - (b+c)$. Substituting this into our expression for the surface area, we get $2(35-(b+c))(b+c) + 2bc$. \n\nNow we want to get rid of the $b+c$ term. Notice that $(b+c)^2 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2$. We know $a^2+b^2+c^2 = 441$, so $a^2 + (b+c)^2 - 2bc = 441$. Substituting $a = 35-(b+c)$, we get $(35-(b+c))^2 + (b+c)^2 - 2bc = 441$. Simplifying, we get $2(b+c)^2 - 70(b+c) + 840 = 441$. \n\nNow let $x = b+c$. Our equation becomes $2x^2 - 70x + 840 = 441$. Simplifying further, we get $2x^2 - 70x + 399 = 0$. Dividing by 2, we have $x^2 - 35x + 199.5 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get two possible values for $x$: $x = 7$ and $x = 28$. Since $x = b+c$ and $a+b+c = 35$, we can't have $x = 28$ because then $a$ would be negative. Therefore, $x = 7$, so $b+c = 7$. \n\nNow we have $a = 35 - (b+c) = 35 - 7 = 28$ and $b+c = 7$. Going back to our expression for the surface area, we have $2a(b+c) + 2bc = 2(28)(7) + 2bc = 392 + 2bc$. We still need to find $bc$. We can use the equation $a^2+b^2+c^2 = 441$ to do this. We know $a = 28$, so $28^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$. Simplifying, we get $b^2 + c^2 = 57$. Since we know $b+c = 7$, we can use the difference of squares factorization to find $bc$: $(b+c)^2 - (b^2 + c^2) = 7^2 - 57 = 49 - 57 = -8$. Therefore, $bc = -4$.\n\nNow we can find the surface area: $392 + 2bc = 392 + 2(-4) = 392 - 8 = \\boxed{384}$.\nThe answer is 384.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the dimensions of the box be $x, y, z$. The sum of the lengths of the twelve edges is $4(x+y+z)$, so we have $4(x+y+z) = 140$, or $x+y+z = 35$. The distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is the space diagonal, which has length $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. So, we have $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = 21$.\n\nNow, we want to find the total surface area of the box, which is $2(xy+xz+yz)$. To do this, we can use the equations we have to eliminate one of the variables and find an expression for the surface area in terms of the other two variables.\n\nLet's eliminate $z$ from the equations. From $x+y+z = 35$, we have $z = 35-x-y$. Substituting this into the space diagonal equation, we have $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(35-x-y)^2} = 21$. Squaring both sides, we get $x^2+y^2+(35-x-y)^2 = 441$. Expanding and simplifying, we have $x^2+y^2-70x-70y+1225 = 441$, or $x^2+y^2-70x-70y+784=0$.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the surface area expression in terms of $x$ and $y$. We have $2(xy+x(35-x-y)+y(35-x-y))$. Expanding and simplifying, we get the surface area as $S = 70x+70y-2x^2-2y^2-2xy$.\n\nAt this point, we can use the equation $x^2+y^2-70x-70y+784=0$ to eliminate either $x^2$ or $y^2$ from the surface area expression. Let's eliminate $x^2$. We have $x^2 = 70x+70y-y^2-784$. Substituting this into the surface area expression, we have $S = 70x+70y-2(70x+70y-y^2-784)-2y^2-2xy$, which simplifies to $S = 1568-4y^2-2xy$.\n\nNow, to minimize the surface area, we can complete the square with respect to $y$. We have $S = 1568-4(y^2+\\frac{1}{2}xy+\\frac{1}{16}x^2)-\\frac{1}{4}x^2$, or $S = 1568-4\\left(y+\\frac{1}{4}x\\right)^2-\\frac{3}{4}x^2$. Since the surface area must be positive, the minimum value occurs when $\\left(y+\\frac{1}{4}x\\right)^2 = 0$, or $y = -\\frac{1}{4}x$. Substituting this back into the equation $x^2+y^2-70x-70y+784=0$, we have $x^2+\\frac{1}{16}x^2-70x+\\frac{35}{2}x+784=0$, or $\\frac{17}{16}x^2-\\frac{105}{2}x+784=0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 16$ (we discard the negative solution as it doesn't make sense for the dimensions of a box).\n\nNow, we can find $y$ and $z$ using the equations we derived earlier.
