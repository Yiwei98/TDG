The midpoint of $M_1M_1'$ is $(15,12)$, so the equation of the perpendicular bisector is $y-12=-2(x-15)$.\n\nThe slope of $M_2M_2'$ is $\\frac{10-0}{24-8}=\\frac{5}{8}$, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is $-\\frac{8}{5}$. The midpoint of $M_2M_2'$ is $(16,5)$, so the equation of the perpendicular bisector is $y-5=-\\frac{8}{5}(x-16)$.\n\nSolving the system of equations formed by the two perpendicular bisectors, we find that the center of rotation is $(x,y)=(10,2)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the angle of rotation. We can use the fact that the distance between the center of rotation and the midpoints of corresponding sides is equal. Let $d_1$ be the distance between $(10,2)$ and $M_1$, and let $d_1'$ be the distance between $(10,2)$ and $M_1'$. Then, we have:\n\n$d_1^2 = (10-0)^2+(2-6)^2=100+16=116$\n$d_1'^2 = (10-30)^2+(2-18)^2=400+256=656$\n\nSince $d_1^2 + d_1'^2 = 116 + 656 = 772$, we can use the Law of Cosines on triangle $M_1M_1'O$ (where O is the center of rotation) to find the cosine of the angle of rotation:\n\n$\\cos(m) = \\frac{d_1^2 + d_1'^2 - M_1M_1'^2}{2 \\cdot d_1 \\cdot d_1'} = \\frac{772 - 900}{2 \\cdot \\sqrt{116} \\cdot \\sqrt{656}} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the angle of rotation is $m=120^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, we have $m+x+y = 120 + 10 + 2 = \\boxed{132}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the midpoints of $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle A'B'C'$.\nFor $\\triangle ABC$, the midpoint of each side is $M_A = (0,6)$, $M_B = (8,0)$, and $M_C = (8,6)$.\nFor $\\triangle A'B'C'$, the midpoint of each side is $M_A' = (30,18)$, $M_B' = (30,10)$, and $M_C' = (24,10)$.\nNow, let's consider the transformation that maps $M_A$ to $M_A'$, $M_B$ to $M_B'$, and $M_C$ to $M_C'$.\nNotice that the transformation is a translation: $M_A$ is translated 30 units to the right and 12 units up to get to $M_A'$, $M_B$ is translated 22 units to the right and 10 units up to get to $M_B'$, and $M_C$ is translated 16 units to the right and 4 units up to get to $M_C'$.\nSince the midpoints are translated, the vertices are also translated by the same amounts.\nThus, the transformation is a translation, not a rotation, so $m=0$.\n\nNow, we find the coordinates of the center of rotation.\nSince the transformation is a translation, the center of rotation can be any point on the plane.\nLet's choose the origin $(0,0)$ as our center of rotation.\nThus, $x=0$ and $y=0$.\n\nFinally, we find $m+x+y=0+0+0=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is 0", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, notice that the triangles are congruent since they share the same side lengths (by the distance formula). So, we know the rotation will not involve any dilation or stretching.\n\nNow, let's find the midpoint of $\\overline{BB'}$. This midpoint will also be the midpoint of $\\overline{AA'}$ and $\\overline{CC'}$. The midpoint of $\\overline{BB'}$ is $M\\left(\\frac{0+36}{2}, \\frac{12+18}{2}\\right) = M(18, 15)$.\n\nNext, let's find the vector from $B$ to $M$: $\\overrightarrow{BM} = \\langle 18, 3 \\rangle$. We want to find the angle of rotation, so let's find the angle between $\\overrightarrow{BM}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AB}$. We can use the dot product formula: $\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BM} = |\\overrightarrow{AB}||\\overrightarrow{BM}|\\cos{\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. We have $\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\langle 0, 12 \\rangle$, so $\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BM} = 0 \\cdot 18 + 12 \\cdot 3 = 36$. The magnitudes of the vectors are $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| = 12$ and $|\\overrightarrow{BM}| = 3\\sqrt{13}$. Thus, we have $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{36}{12 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{13}}$. Therefore, $\\theta = \\arccos{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{13}}}$, which is approximately $75.96$ degrees.\n\nNow, we want to find the center of rotation. Let this point be $P(x, y)$. Since $P$ is the center of rotation, $AP = A'P$, $BP = B'P$, and $CP = C'P$. We can use the distance formula and set the distances equal:\n\n$AP^2 = A'P^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = (x - 24)^2 + (y - 18)^2$.\n\n$BP^2 = B'P^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + (y - 12)^2 = (x - 36)^2 + (y - 18)^2$.\n\nWe can simplify the first equation to $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 48x + 576 + y^2 - 36y + 324 \\Rightarrow 48x + 36y = 900$. Dividing by 12, we get $4x + 3y = 75$.\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get $x^2 + y^2 - 24y + 144 = x^2 - 72x + 1296 + y^2 - 36y + 324 \\Rightarrow 72x - 12y = 1176$. Dividing by 12, we get $6x - y = 98$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ and $y$: $y = 6x - 98$, so $4x + 3(6x - 98) = 75$. Simplifying and solving, we get $x = 7$. Substituting back, we get $y = 6(7) - 98 = -56$. So, the center of rotation is $(7, -56)$.\n\nFinally, we have $m + x + y = 75.96 + 7 - 56 = \\boxed{26.96}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we draw the two triangles on the coordinate plane.\nThe midpoint of the segment $\\overline{BB'}$ is $M = \\left( 18, 15 \\right)$.\nSince a rotation preserves distances, the center of rotation must be equidistant from $A$ and $A'$.\nThus, the center of rotation must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $\\overline{AA'}$.\nThe midpoint of the segment $\\overline{AA'}$ is $N = \\left( 12, 9 \\right)$.\nThe slope of the line containing the segment $\\overline{AA'}$ is $\\frac{18}{24} = \\frac{3}{4}$,\nso the slope of the perpendicular bisector of the segment $\\overline{AA'}$ is $-\\frac{4}{3}$.\nThe equation of the line through $N$ with slope $-\\frac{4}{3}$ is $y - 9 = -\\frac{4}{3}(x - 12)$,\nor $3y - 27 = -4x + 48$, which simplifies to $4x + 3y = 75$.\nSince the center of rotation is equidistant from $B$ and $B'$,\nit must also lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $\\overline{BB'}$.\nThe midpoint of the segment $\\overline{BB'}$ is $P = \\left( 18, 15 \\right)$.\nThe slope of the line containing the segment $\\overline{BB'}$ is $\\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}$,\nso the slope of the perpendicular bisector of the segment $\\overline{BB'}$ is $-6$.\nThe equation of the line through $P$ with slope $-6$ is $y - 15 = -6(x - 18)$,\nor $y - 15 = -6x + 108$, which simplifies to $6x + y = 93$.\nNow, we solve the system of linear equations \\[\\begin{aligned} 4x + 3y &= 75, \\\\ 6x + y &= 93. \\end{aligned}\\]\nSubtracting the first equation from twice the second equation, we get $8x = 111$, so $x = \\frac{111}{8}$.\nSubstituting into the first equation, we get $y = \\frac{57}{8}$.\nLet $O = \\left( \\frac{111}{8}, \\frac{57}{8} \\right)$ be the center of rotation.\nNow, we find the angle of rotation.\nLet $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$.\nThen $D = \\left( 0, 3 \\right)$ and $AD = 3$.\nLet $D'$ be the foot of the altitude from $A'$ to $\\overline{B'C'}$.\nThen $D' = \\left( 24, 9 \\right)$ and $A'D' = 9$.\nLet $E = \\left( 0, \\frac{57}{8} \\right)$.\nThen $AE = \\frac{57}{8}$ and $A'E = \\frac{15}{8}$.\nSince $\\triangle AEO \\sim \\triangle A'D'E$ and $\\triangle ADO \\sim \\triangle A'OD'$, we have \\[\\frac{EO}{DO} = \\frac{A'E}{AD} = \\frac{A'D'}{A'D}.\\]\nIt follows that $\\angle A'OA = \\angle A'OD' - \\angle AOA = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle AOA$.\nTherefore, the angle of rotation is $m = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle AOA$.\nSince $\\cos \\angle AOA = \\frac{AD}{AO}$, we have \\[\\cos \\angle AOA = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{111}{8} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{57}{8} \\right)^2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{222}}.\\]\nIt follows that $\\cos \\angle A'OA = -\\cos \\angle AOA = -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{222}}$.\nThus, \\[m = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle AOA = \\arccos \\left( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{222}} \\right).\\]\nFinally, we have $m + x + y = \\arccos \\left( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{222}} \\right) + \\frac{111}{8} + \\frac{57}{8} = \\boxed{\\arccos \\left( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{222}} \\right) + \\frac{84}{4}}$.\nThe answer is \\arccos \\left( -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{222}} \\right) + \\frac{84}{4}", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's find the midpoints of the sides of both triangles.\nFor $\\triangle ABC$, we have:\n$M_{AB} = (0, 6)$, $M_{BC} = (8, 6)$, and $M_{AC} = (8, 0)$.\n\nFor $\\triangle A'B'C'$, we have:\n$M_{A'B'} = (30, 18)$, $M_{B'C'} = (30, 10)$, and $M_{A'C'} = (24, 10)$.\n\nNotice that the midpoint of the side opposite the right angle in both triangles is the center of rotation, as it remains equidistant from all vertices during the rotation. In this case, it's $M_{BC}$ for $\\triangle ABC$ and $M_{B'C'}$ for $\\triangle A'B'C'$. Thus, the center of rotation is $(8, 6)$.\n\nNext, we find the lengths of the corresponding sides of the triangles to determine the scale factor of the dilation.
