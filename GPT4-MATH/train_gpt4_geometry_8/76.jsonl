Since $ABCD$ is a rhombus, the semiperimeters of the two triangles are equal, i.e., $s_1 = s_2 = s$. Therefore, $K = (r_1 + r_2)s = (12.5 + 25)s = 37.5s$.\nNow, let's find the semiperimeter $s$. Let $a$ be the side length of the rhombus and $h$ be the height of triangle $ABD$. Then, the area of triangle $ABD$ can also be expressed as $K_1 = \\frac{1}{2}ah$.
