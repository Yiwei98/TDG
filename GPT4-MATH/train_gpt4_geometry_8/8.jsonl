Then, $OB=OC=19$. Let $x=AP$ and $y=PM$. Then, $x+y=152$ and $x^2+y^2=19^2+19^2=722$. We want to find $OP=19\\cdot\\frac{y}{x}$. \nNow, we have the following system of equations:\n$x+y=152$\n$x^2+y^2=722$\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. For example, we can rewrite the first equation as $y=152-x$ and substitute it into the second equation to get $x^2+(152-x)^2=722$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $x^2-304x+23104=0$. Factoring, we get $(x-76)(x-304)=0$. Since $x+y=152$, we have $x=76$ and $y=76$. Thus, $OP=19\\cdot\\frac{y}{x}=19$, so the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{20}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $B$ be the point of tangency on $\\overline{AM}$ and $C$ be the point of tangency on $\\overline{PM}$. Then, $OP \\perp BC$. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $O$ to $\\overline{PM}$. Then, $\\triangle OBD \\sim \\triangle PAM$.\n\nSince $OB = OD = 19$, we have $BD = 38$. Let $AP = x$ and $PM = y$. Then, $AM = x + y$ and $152 = x + y + x + y = 2x + 2y$. Thus, $x + y = 76$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle OBD$, we have $x^2 - 38x = 19^2$. Since $x + y = 76$, we have $y = 76 - x$. Substituting this into the equation $x^2 - 38x = 19^2$, we get $(76 - y)^2 - 38(76 - y) = 19^2$. Expanding and simplifying, we have $y^2 - 38y = 19^2$.\n\nNow, we have the system of equations \\[x^2 - 38x = y^2 - 38y = 19^2.\\] Thus, $x^2 - y^2 = 38(x - y)$. Since $x \\neq y$, we can divide by $x - y$ to get \\[x + y = 38.\\] But we also have $x + y = 76$. This is a contradiction, so there are no such triangles, and the requested sum is $m + n = \\boxed{0}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be the points of tangency on $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{PM}$, respectively.\nNote that $\\angle OYP$ and $\\angle OXA$ are right angles.\nLet $AP=a$ and $PM=b$.\nThen, by the Pythagorean theorem, $AM=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nSince the perimeter of triangle $APM$ is $152$, we have $a+b+\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=152$.\n\nNow, we use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle have equal lengths.\nThus, $AY=PY=x$ and $XP=AM-OA=x-19$.\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangles $OPY$ and $OAX$, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nOP^2 &= (x-19)^2 + b^2 \\\\\nOP^2 &= x^2 + (a-19)^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSetting these two equations equal, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-19)^2 + b^2 &= x^2 + (a-19)^2 \\\\\na^2 - 38a + 361 &= b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&=152 \\\\\na^2 - 38a + 361 &= b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving for $b$ in the first equation, we get $b=152-a-\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nSquaring both sides and substituting for $b^2$ using the second equation, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n(152-a-\\sqrt{a^2+b^2})^2 &= a^2 - 38a + 361 \\\\\n2304 - 304a + a^2 - 304\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} + 2a\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} &= a^2 - 38a + 361\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying and dividing by $2$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n972 - 133a + a\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} &= 304\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, let $k=a^2+b^2$.
