Triangle $BCG$ and $FDG$ are congruent triangles. The area of the shaded region $DHF$ is the area of $FGD$ minus $DGH$.\n\nTriangle $DGH$ is similar to triangle $BGC$. We can prove this because $\\angle BGC =\\angle DGH$. Also, $\\overline{DE}$ has slope $2$ and $\\overline{BF}$ has slope $-\\frac12$, which are negative reciprocals, so the two lines are perpendicular and create the right angle $\\angle GHD$. Therefore, $\\angle GHD = \\angle BCG = 90^{\\circ}$. Since the two triangles have two of the same angle measures, they are similar. Therefore, we have the ratios $\\frac{GD}{BG}=\\frac{GH}{CG}=\\frac{DH}{BC}$. We can find that $BG$ using the Pythagorean formula. \\begin{align*}\nBC^2+CG^2 &= BG^2 \\\\\n5^2+10^2 = 125 &= BG^2 \\\\\nBG &= 5\\sqrt5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we have $\\frac{5}{5\\sqrt5}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt5}=\\frac{GH}{5}=\\frac{DH}{10}$. We solve for the length of the two legs of triangle $DGH$ to find that $GH=\\sqrt{5}$ and $DH=2\\sqrt{5}$.

The area is then $\\frac{1}{2} CD \\cdot AB = \\frac{1}{2} (29^3) \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\nSetting these two expressions for the area equal, we get:\n$\\frac{1}{2} ab = \\frac{1}{2} (29^3) \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$\nDividing by $\\frac{1}{2}$ and rearranging, we get:\n$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\frac{ab}{29^3}$\nNow we need to find $\\cos B$. Using the definition of cosine in a right triangle, we have $\\cos B = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$.\nSubstitute our expression for $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ from above:\n$\\cos B = \\frac{a}{\\frac{ab}{29^3}} = \\frac{29^3}{b}$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers and $\\cos B$ is in lowest terms, $b = 29^3$ and $a = m$.\nNow, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $AB$:\n$AB = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{m^2 + (29^3)^2} = 29^2 \\sqrt{m^2 + 29^2}$\nFinally, we have $\\cos B = \\frac{m}{29^3}$, so $m+n = m + 29^3 = \\boxed{24390}$.\nThe answer is 24390", "Let's think step by step\nLet $a = AC$, $b = BC$, and $c = AB$.
