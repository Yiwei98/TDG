Then we have $a_1a_3 = a_2 + 1 = 2001$. Since $a_1$ and $a_3$ are positive, we know that $a_1 > 1$ and $a_3 > 1$.\n\nNow let's consider the next term in the sequence, $a_4$. We have $a_2a_4 = a_3 + 1$, or $2000a_4 = y + 1$. Since $y = \\frac{2001}{x}$, we have $2000a_4 = \\frac{2001}{x} + 1$. Thus, $x(2000a_4 - 1) = 2001$.\n\nNow we can see that $x$ divides $2001$. The prime factorization of $2001$ is $3 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 29$. Since $x > 1$, there are $2^3 - 1 = 7$ possible values of $x$.

We want to find how many values of $x = a_1$ make $a_n = 2001$ for some $n \\ge 1$.\n\nWe will show that if $a_n = 2001$ for some $n \\ge 1$, then $a_{n-1} = 1999$. Suppose $a_n = 2001$. Then, from the recursive relation, we have $a_{n+1} = a_na_{n-1} - 1 = 2000a_{n-1} - 1$. Since $a_{n+1}$ is positive, we have $2000a_{n-1} > 1$, so $a_{n-1} > \\frac{1}{2000}$. Since $a_{n-1}$ is a positive integer, this means $a_{n-1} \\ge 1$. But if $a_{n-1} \\ge 2$, then $2000a_{n-1} \\ge 4000$, which means $a_{n+1} \\ge 3999$, contradicting the fact that $a_{n+1} = a_na_{n-1} - 1 \\le 2001 \\cdot 2001 - 1 < 3999$. Thus, $a_{n-1} = 1$, as claimed.\n\nNow, let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that $a_k = 1$. Then, since $a_{k+1} = a_ka_{k-1} - 1 = a_{k-1} - 1$, we have $a_{k+1} = 0$. Thus, for any $n > k + 1$, we have $a_n = a_{n-1}a_{n-2} - 1 = 0 \\cdot a_{n-2} - 1 = -1$, which is not positive, so the sequence terminates at the term $a_{k+1} = 0$.
