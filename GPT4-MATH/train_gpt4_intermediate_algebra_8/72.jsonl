{"question": "Suppose\n$$a(2+i)^4 + b(2+i)^3 + c(2+i)^2 + b(2+i) + a = 0,$$where $a,b,c$ are integers whose greatest common divisor is $1$.  Determine $|c|$.", "answer": "Let $f(x) = ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+bx+a$. Thus, the problem asserts that $x=2+i$ is a root of $f$.\n\nNote the symmetry of the coefficients.  In particular, we have $f\\left(\\frac 1x\\right) = \\frac{f(x)}{x^4}$ for all $x\\ne 0$. Thus, if $x=r$ is any root of $f(x)$, then $x=\\frac 1r$ is also a root.\n\nIn particular, $x=\\frac 1{2+i}$ is a root. To write this root in standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n$$\\frac 1{2+i} = \\frac 1{2+i}\\cdot\\frac{2-i}{2-i} = \\frac{2-i}5 = \\frac 25-\\frac 15i.$$Now we have two nonreal roots of $f$. Since $f$ has real coefficients, the conjugates of its roots are also roots. Therefore, the four roots of $f$ are $2\\pm i$ and $\\frac 25\\pm\\frac 15i$.\n\nThe monic quadratic whose roots are $2\\pm i$ is $(x-2-i)(x-2+i) = (x-2)^2-i^2 = x^2-4x+5$.\n\nThe monic quadratic whose roots are $\\frac 25\\pm\\frac 15i$ is $\\left(x-\\frac 25-\\frac 15i\\right)\\left(x-\\frac 25+\\frac 15i\\right) = \\left(x-\\frac 25\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac 15i\\right)^2 = x^2-\\frac 45x+\\frac 15$.\n\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= a(x^2-4x+5)\\left(x^2-\\frac 45x+\\frac 15\\right) \\\\\n&= a\\left(x^4-\\frac{24}5x^3+\\frac{42}5x^2-\\frac{24}5x+1\\right),\n\\end{align*}so\n$a,b,c$ are in the ratio $1:-\\frac{24}5:\\frac{42}5$.

Since $a,b,c$ are integers whose greatest common divisor is 1, the greatest common divisor of $56a+14b+4c+b$ and $56a+14b+c+2b+a$ is also 1.  But $56a+14b+4c+b$ is divisible by 7, so $56a+14b+c+2b+a$ must not be divisible by 7.  The only way for this to happen is if $c$ is not divisible by 7, and $56a+14b+c+2b+a$ is divisible by 7.  This means $c+2b+a$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSince $c$ is not divisible by 7, $|c|$ must be at least 14.
