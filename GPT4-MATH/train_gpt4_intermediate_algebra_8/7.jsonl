Testing the remaining possibilities, we find that $c = 4$ and $c = 6$ are the only valid roots.\n\nWhen $c = 4$, we have $d = 24$, and $a = 6$, $b = 9$. When $c = 6$, we have $d = 16$, and $a = 9$, $b = 6$. Both cases give the same sum of squares: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 6^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + 24^2 = 36 + 81 + 16 + 576 = \\boxed{709}$.\n\nThe answer is 709.", "Let's think step by step\nFrom the first equation, we get $b = 15 - a$. Substitute this into the second equation to get $a(15-a) + c + d = 78$. This simplifies to $-a^2 + 15a + c + d = 78$.\nNow, let's consider the third equation: $ad + bc = 160$. Substitute $b = 15 - a$ and $c = 96/d$ (from the fourth equation) to get $a(15-a)d + (15-a)(96/d) = 160$. Multiply both sides by $d$ to eliminate the fraction: $a(15-a)d^2 + (15-a)(96) = 160d$. This simplifies to $-a^3d + 15a^2d + 96a - 160d = 0$.\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. $-a^2 + 15a + c + d = 78$\n2. $-a^3d + 15a^2d + 96a - 160d = 0$\nLet's eliminate $d$ by solving the first equation for $d$ and substituting it into the second equation. We get $d = 78 - 15a + a^2 - c$. Substituting this into the second equation gives: $-a^3(78 - 15a + a^2 - c) + 15a^2(78 - 15a + a^2 - c) + 96a - 160(78 - 15a + a^2 - c) = 0$.\nNow, let's eliminate $c$ by solving the fourth equation for $c$ and substituting it into the equation above. We get $c = 96/d$. Substituting this into the equation above gives: $-a^3(78 - 15a + a^2 - 96/d) + 15a^2(78 - 15a + a^2 - 96/d) + 96a - 160(78 - 15a + a^2 - 96/d) = 0$.\nNow, we have an equation with only $a$ and $d$. We can solve this equation for $a$ or $d$ and then use the other equations to find the other variables. However, this equation is quite complex, and solving it directly may not be the best approach. Instead, let's try to simplify the equation further.\nFirst, let's expand the equation and combine like terms: $-a^5d + 15a^4 - 2a^3d^2 + 96a^3 - 160a^2d + 225a^2 - 1440a + 12480 = 0$.\nNow, let's factor out $a$ from the equation: $a(-a^4d + 15a^3 - 2a^2d^2 + 96a^2 - 160ad + 225a - 1440) + 12480 = 0$.\nWe can now solve for $a$ by setting the equation inside the parentheses equal to zero: $-a^4d + 15a^3 - 2a^2d^2 + 96a^2 - 160ad + 225a - 1440 = 0$. This is a quartic equation in $a$ with coefficients involving $d$. We can solve this equation using numerical methods or by making some observations about the possible values of $a$ and $d$.\nFirst, note that if $a = 0$, then $b = 15$, $c = 0$, and $d = 96$. This gives us one solution: $(0, 15, 0, 96)$. However, we are looking for the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, so we want to find a solution where $a$ is non-zero.\nNow, let's look at the equation $-a^4d + 15a^3 - 2a^2d^2 + 96a^2 - 160ad + 225a - 1440 = 0$. If $a$ is positive, then the $a^4d$ term will be positive, and the equation will not have any solutions for $d > 0$. Therefore, we must have $a < 0$.\nIf $a < 0$, then the $a^4d$ term will be negative, and the equation will have solutions for $d > 0$. We can now try to find the largest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ by trying different values of $a$ and solving for $d$. After some trial and error, we find that the largest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ occurs when $a = -3$, $b = 18$, $c = 3$, and $d = 32$. This gives us a value of $(-3)^2 + 18^2 + 3^2 + 32^2 = \\boxed{1249}$.\nThe answer is 1249", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we can rewrite the third equation as $ad+bc=160 \\Rightarrow ab+cd=160-dc$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $ab+c+d=78$.\nSubtracting these two equations, we get $c+d-dc=42$.\nNow, notice that $c+d=2\\sqrt{cd}=2\\sqrt{96}=24$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get $24-dc=42 \\Rightarrow dc=18$.\nHowever, we know that $cd=96$, which is a contradiction.\nThus, there is no solution $(a,b,c,d)$ to the given system of equations, and the greatest possible value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ is $\\boxed{\\text{not defined}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFrom the first equation, we have $b = 15 - a$.

Since $d$ is a factor of 96, the possible values for $(a, d)$ are $(2, 48)$, $(3, 32)$, and $(4, 24)$.
