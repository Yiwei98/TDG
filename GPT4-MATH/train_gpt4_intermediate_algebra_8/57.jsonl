In general, for the powers of $x^k$ where $k$ is even, the coefficient is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and for the powers of $x^k$ where $k$ is odd, the coefficient is $-\\frac{1}{3}$. This pattern will continue when we multiply by $P(x^5)$, $P(x^7)$, and $P(x^9)$.\n\nNow, we count the number of coefficients of each power of $x^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 50$. We have:\n\n- 1 coefficient of $x^0$\n- 5 coefficients of $x^1$\n- 10 coefficients of $x^2$\n- 10 coefficients of $x^3$\n- 10 coefficients of $x^4$\n- 10 coefficients of $x^5$\n- 4 coefficients of $x^6$\n- 1 coefficient of $x^7$\n\nThe sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is then\n\\[1\\cdot\\left|\\frac{1}{6}\\right| + 5\\cdot\\left|-\\frac{1}{3}\\right| + 10\\cdot\\left|\\frac{1}{6}\\right| + 10\\cdot\\left|-\\frac{1}{3}\\right| + 10\\cdot\\left|\\frac{1}{6}\\right| + 10\\cdot\\left|-\\frac{1}{3}\\right| + 4\\cdot\\left|\\frac{1}{6}\\right| + 1\\cdot\\left|-\\frac{1}{3}\\right|.\\]\nSimplifying, we get\n\\[\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{10}{6} + \\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{10}{6} + \\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{41}{2}}.\\]\nThe answer is \\frac{41}{2}.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, notice that the exponents of the polynomial $P(x)$ are all even. Thus, when we multiply $P(x)$ by itself, the exponents will still be even. This means that when we multiply $P(x)$ by $P(x^3)$, the exponents in the resulting polynomial will still be even. This pattern continues for all the other factors of $Q(x)$, so all the exponents in $Q(x)$ will be even.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of $x^0$ in $Q(x)$. Since the exponents are all even, the only way to get an $x^0$ term is by multiplying the constant terms of each factor. Thus, the coefficient of $x^0$ in $Q(x)$ is $1^5 = 1$.\n\nNext, let's find the coefficient of $x^2$ in $Q(x)$. We can obtain an $x^2$ term by multiplying the $x^2$ term in one factor by the constant terms in the other four factors. There are five ways to choose which factor contributes the $x^2$ term, and the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in each factor is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Thus, the coefficient of $x^2$ in $Q(x)$ is $5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the coefficient of $x^4$ in $Q(x)$. We can obtain an $x^4$ term by multiplying the $x^4$ term in one factor by the constant terms in the other four factors, or by multiplying the $x^2$ terms in two factors by the constant terms in the other three factors. There are five ways to choose which factor contributes the $x^4$ term, and the coefficient of the $x^4$ term in each factor is $\\frac{1}{6^2}$. There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose which two factors contribute the $x^2$ terms, and the product of the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms in two factors is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2$. Thus, the coefficient of $x^4$ in $Q(x)$ is $5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6^2} + 10 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5}{6^2} + \\frac{10}{6^2} = \\frac{15}{6^2}$.\n\nWe can continue this process to find the coefficients of all the even exponents in $Q(x)$. Then, we can sum the absolute values of these coefficients to find $\\sum_{i=0}^{50} |a_i|$.\n\nThe sum is $1 + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{15}{6^2} + \\frac{35}{6^3} + \\cdots + \\frac{24310}{6^{10}}$. This is a finite geometric series with first term $1$, common ratio $\\frac{5}{6}$, and 11 terms. The sum of this series is\n\n$$\\frac{1\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{11}\\right)}{1-\\frac{5}{6}} = \\frac{6^{11} - 5^{11}}{6^{10}}$$\n\nSo, $\\sum_{i=0}^{50} |a_i| = \\boxed{\\frac{6^{11} - 5^{11}}{6^{10}}}$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}

This is because the height of the region is given by $y = x\\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor$, which is linear within each segment. Therefore, if $A(n)$ is an integer for some $n$ within a segment, it will also be an integer for all other $n$ within that segment.\n\nTo see this more clearly, let's consider the first segment. The area of the region for any $n$ within this segment can be found by integrating the equation $y = x$ from $x = 1$ to $x = n$:\n$$A(n) = \\int_{1}^{n} x\\, dx = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\right]_{1}^{n} = \\frac{1}{2}n^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$$\nIf $A(n)$ is an integer, then $n^2 - 1$ must be even.
