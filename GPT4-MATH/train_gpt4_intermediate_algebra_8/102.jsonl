We can start by checking for small prime factors.\n$5809$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$. Checking for $5$, we see that $5809 - 5000 = 809$, which is not divisible by $5$. Checking for $7$, we see that $5809 - 7 \\cdot 840 = 29$, which is a prime number. So, $5809 = 7 \\cdot 829$.\nSince $829$ is a prime number and larger than $7$, the largest prime divisor of $5809$ is $\\boxed{829}$.\nThe answer is 829", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we simplify the expression: $25^2 + 72^2 = 625 + 5184 = 5809$.\nNow, we want to find the largest prime divisor of 5809.

We continue to find the prime divisors of 644:\n$644 \\div 2 = 322$ (divisible by 2)\nNow, we have $322 = 2 \\times 161$.

Since 5809 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\nNext, we can check if 5809 is divisible by 3. We can use the divisibility rule for 3: if the sum of a number's digits is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. The sum of 5809's digits is 5+8+0+9=22, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 5809 is not divisible by 3.\nNow, we can check if 5809 is divisible by 5. Since 5809 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.\nNext, we can check if 5809 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7: double the last digit of the number, subtract the result from the rest of the number, and if the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. Doubling the last digit of 5809 gives us 18, and subtracting 18 from 580 gives us 562. Since 562 is not divisible by 7, neither is 5809.\nWe can continue checking prime numbers, but as we go, we can see that 5809 has no prime divisors less than its square root (approximately 76.2). Therefore, 5809 must be prime itself.\nSo, the largest prime divisor of $25^2 + 72^2$ is $\\boxed{5809}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we simplify the expression: $25^2 + 72^2 = 625 + 5184 = 5809$.\nNow, we find the prime factors of 5809.\nWe start by checking if 5809 is divisible by the smallest prime, 2. Since 5809 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\nNext, we check if 5809 is divisible by 3. $58 + 9 = 67$, which is not divisible by 3, so 5809 is not divisible by 3.\nNext, we check if 5809 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\nNext, we check if 5809 is divisible by 7. Using the divisibility rule for 7 (subtract twice the last digit from the remaining digits), we get $580 - 18 = 562$. Repeating the process, we get $56 - 4 = 52$. Since 52 is not divisible by 7, 5809 is not divisible by 7.\nNext, we check if 5809 is divisible by 11. The alternating sum of the digits is $5 - 8 + 0 - 9 = -12$, which is not divisible by 11, so 5809 is not divisible by 11.\nNext, we check if 5809 is divisible by 13. We can use the divisibility rule for 13 (add 4 times the last digit to the remaining digits): $580 + 4(9) = 616$. Repeating the process, we get $61 + 4(6) = 85$. Since 85 is divisible by 13 (13 x 5 = 65, and 85 - 65 = 20), 5809 is divisible by 13.\nNow we divide 5809 by 13: $5809 / 13 = 13 \\times 29 \\times 13$.\nSince 13 and 29 are both prime, the largest prime divisor of $25^2 + 72^2$ is $\\boxed{29}$.\nThe answer is 29"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}

Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\\pm 1, \\pm 7)$, $(\\pm 7, \\pm 1)$, and $(\\pm 5, \\pm 5)$ (where the two $\\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).\n\nThere are $\\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line.
