Since $0 \\leq \\{x\\} < 1$, the minimum value of $2\\{x\\}-1$ is $-1$ and the maximum value is $1$. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $[0, 1]$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation $nf(xf(x))=x$. Since $0 \\leq f(x) \\leq 1$, we have $0 \\leq xf(x) \\leq x$. Therefore, $0 \\leq f(xf(x)) \\leq 1$, and $0 \\leq nf(xf(x)) \\leq n$.

Thus, $x = 0$ is a solution for any positive integer $n$. For any other solution $x$, we must have $0 < nf(xf(x)) < n$. Since $x = nf(xf(x))$, we can write $x = k$ for some integer $k$ such that $0 < k < n$.

Therefore, $0 \\leq f(kf(k)) \\leq 1$, and $0 \\leq nf(kf(k)) \\leq n$. Thus, the range of $nf(kf(k))$ is $[0,n]$. The number of solutions for each $k$ is the number of times the graph of $y = nf(kf(k))$ intersects the line $y = k$ in the interval $0 < k < n$. Since the graph of $y = nf(kf(k))$ is continuous and increasing, it intersects the line $y = k$ at most once in the interval $0 < k < n$. Therefore, there is at most one solution for each positive integer $k$.\n\nTo have at least $2012$ real solutions, we need the equation to have at least $2012$ integer solutions.

We will show that the equation $2012f(xf(x)) = x$ has at least 2012 real solutions. Since $f(x) = 0$ if and only if $x$ is an integer, the equation $2012f(xf(x)) = x$ has a solution at every integer $x$. Now, consider the equation $2012f(xf(x)) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ if and only if $x = \\frac{1}{4}$ or $x = \\frac{3}{4}$, we have $2012f(\\frac{1}{4}f(\\frac{1}{4})) = 2012f(\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}) = 2012f(\\frac{1}{8}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and similarly $2012f(\\frac{3}{4}f(\\frac{3}{4})) = \\frac{1}{2}$.
