From the equation $f(x) - f(-x) = 6x$, this occurs when $x = 0$. Since $f(x)$ is not defined for $x = 0$, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nNow, suppose $x \\neq 0$. Then from the equation $f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) - f \\left( -\\frac{1}{x} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} x + \\frac{3}{2x}$, we want to find the real solutions to\n\\[\\frac{3}{2} x + \\frac{3}{2x} = 0.\\]This simplifies to $x^2 = -1$, which has no real solutions.\n\nThus, the real solutions to $f(x) = f(-x)$ are $\\boxed{\\text{none}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's plug in $x$ and $-x$ into the given equation:\n\\[f(x) + 2f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = 3x\\]\n\\[f(-x) + 2f \\left( \\frac{-1}{x} \\right) = -3x\\]\nSince we want the solutions to $f(x) = f(-x)$, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\\[f(x) + 2f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = f(-x) + 2f \\left( \\frac{-1}{x} \\right)\\]\n\\[2f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) - 2f \\left( \\frac{-1}{x} \\right) = 6x\\]\nNow, let $y = \\frac{1}{x}$, so $x = \\frac{1}{y}$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\\[2f(y) - 2f(-y) = 6\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)\\]\n\\[f(y) - f(-y) = 3y\\]\nNow, we can plug in $y = \\frac{1}{x}$ again to get:\n\\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{-1}{x}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\]\nSince this equation is equal to the one we derived earlier, we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[2f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) - 2f \\left( \\frac{-1}{x} \\right) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{-1}{x}\\right)\\]\n\\[f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = f \\left( \\frac{-1}{x} \\right)\\]\nSince this equation holds for all non-zero real numbers $x$, the solutions to $f(x) = f(-x)$ are all non-zero real numbers. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)}."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
