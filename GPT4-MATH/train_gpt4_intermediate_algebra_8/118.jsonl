Therefore, the centroid of the polygon is at the origin. \n\nWe can now use the triangle inequality to find the minimum perimeter. The triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. We can apply this to any three consecutive vertices of the polygon. Let $a, b, c$ be the distances from the origin to these consecutive vertices. Then, by the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n$a + b > c$\n$b + c > a$\n$c + a > b$\n\nAdding these inequalities, we get $2(a + b + c) > a + b + c$, which implies that the perimeter of the polygon is greater than or equal to $a + b + c$. Since the polygon has 8 sides, the minimum perimeter is $8(a + b + c)$. \n\nNow, we can find the distances $a, b, c$ for the roots of the two quadratics. For the roots of the first quadratic, we have $a = 1, b = 1, c = 1$. For the roots of the second quadratic, we have $a = \\sqrt{2}, b = \\sqrt{2}, c = \\sqrt{2}$.
