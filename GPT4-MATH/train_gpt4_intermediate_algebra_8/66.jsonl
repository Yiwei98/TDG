Expanding this, we get $2(x^3 - (2r+s)x^2 + (r^2+2rs)x - r^2s)$. By matching coefficients with the given polynomial, we have $2r^2s = k$. We know that $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 60$, and we found that $3r^2 + 8r - 44 = 0$. Solving for $s$ in terms of $r$ from the equation $r+s=-4$, we have $s=-4-r$. Substituting this into the equation $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 60$, we get $r^2 - 8r + 16 = 60$. This simplifies to $r^2 - 8r - 44 = 0$. \n\nSince $3r^2 + 8r - 44 = 0$, we can divide this equation by 3 to get $r^2 - \\frac{8}{3}r - \\frac{44}{3} = 0$. Comparing this to the equation $r^2 - 8r - 44 = 0$, we can see that they have the same roots for $r$. Therefore, the roots of the quadratic equation $r^2 - \\frac{8}{3}r - \\frac{44}{3} = 0$ are the same as the roots of the equation $r^2 - 8r - 44 = 0$. Solving for $r$ using the quadratic formula, we get $r = \\frac{8}{6} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{(-\\frac{8}{3})^2 - 4(-\\frac{44}{3})}}{2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{64}}{3}$. Thus, $r = \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{8}{3} = 4$ or $r = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} = -\\frac{4}{3}$. If $r=4$, then $s=-4-r=-8$, and if $r=-\\frac{4}{3}$, then $s=-4-r=\\frac{8}{3}$. In either case, the product $r^2s$ is the same, so $k = 2r^2s = 2(4^2)(-8) = \\boxed{256}$. The answer is 256."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
