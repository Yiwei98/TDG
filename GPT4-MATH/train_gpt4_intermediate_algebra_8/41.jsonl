This gives us the largest possible value of $c$ as $3(125.25 - 159/2) = 139$.\nHence, the largest possible two-day success ratio for Beta is $(159+139)/(299+200) = 298/499$.\nThe answer is \\frac{298}{499}.", "Let's think step by step\nAlpha scored $\\frac{160}{300} = \\frac{8}{15}$ on the first day and $\\frac{140}{200} = \\frac{7}{10}$ on the second day.\nBeta did not attempt 300 points on the first day, so the maximum number of points Beta could have attempted on the first day is 299.
