We can also add the second and third equations to get $2ac + 2ab + 2bc = 644$. Subtracting the first sum from the second sum, we get $bc - ab = 8$.\n\nNow, we have the following system of equations:\n$ac - ab = 8$\n$bc - ab = 8$\n\nSince both equations are equal to 8, we can set them equal to each other: $ac - ab = bc - ab$. This simplifies to $ac = bc$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, we can divide both sides by $ab$ to get $c = b$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $c=b$ into the equation $ab + bc = 162$. This gives us $ab + b^2 = 162$. Since we know that $ab + ac = 152$, we can substitute $c=b$ into this equation as well to get $ab + ab = 152$, which simplifies to $2ab = 152$.

If $x_1$ is a root of $f(f(x)) = 0,$ then we must have $f(x_1) = r_1.$  But the equation $f(x) = r_1$ has at most two roots.  Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 0$ must have two distinct roots.

This gives us $c = 9$. Now we have $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x+3)^2$. The unique root of $f(x)$ is $r = -3$. We find $f(r) = f(-3) = 0$, and $f(f(r)) = f(0) = 9$.

Now consider the quadratic $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$. Since it is a quadratic, it can have at most two distinct roots. Thus, $f(f(x))$ can have at most three distinct roots: one root $r$ such that $f(r)$ is a double root of $f(x)$, and two roots $s$ and $t$ such that $f(s)$ and $f(t)$ are the two distinct roots of $f(x)$. So, for $f(f(x))$ to have exactly three distinct real roots, these cases must occur.\n\nNow let $f(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of $f(x)$. Then $c = r_1 r_2$. Since $f(r)$ is a double root of $f(x)$, we have $f(r) = r_1 = r_2$. It follows that $c = r_1^2$. We are given that $r$ is a root of $f(f(x))$, so $f(f(r)) = f(r_1) = r_1$. Thus, $r_1$ is a fixed point of $f(x)$, which means that $f(r_1) = r_1$. We have $r_1^2 + 6r_1 + c = r_1$. Substituting $c = r_1^2$, we get $6r_1 = -r_1$, so $r_1 = 0$. Then $c = r_1^2 = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = x(x+6)$.\n\nNow $f(f(x)) = f(x^2+6x) = (x^2+6x)(x^2+6x+6)$. We see that $f(f(x))$ has roots $x=0$, $x=-6$, and $x=-2$, which are three distinct real roots.

Since $f(f(x))$ is a quartic polynomial, this means that it must have a double root and two single roots. Let $r$ be the double root, so $f(f(r)) = f'(f(r)) = 0$.\n\nWe have $f(r) = r^2 + 6r + c = 0$, and $f'(x) = 2x + 6$. Thus, $f'(f(r)) = 2(r^2 + 6r + c) + 6 = 0$. Substituting the expression for $f(r)$, we get $2(0) + 6 = 0$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $f(f(x))$ cannot have exactly $3$ distinct real roots for any value of $c$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first find the vertex of the parabola $y = f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{6}{2\\cdot1} = -3$. Thus, the vertex is at the point $(-3, f(-3)) = (-3, 9+c)$. \n\nNow, let $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ be the three distinct real roots of $f(f(x))$. Then, $f(r_1) = f(r_2) = f(r_3)$. Since the parabola $y = f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x = -3$, we must have $r_2 = -3$ (the vertex) and $r_1 = -3 - k$ and $r_3 = -3 + k$ for some positive number $k$. Thus, $f(r_1) = f(-3 - k) = (-3 - k)^2 + 6(-3 - k) + c = k^2 - 6k + c = f(-3 + k) = f(r_3)$.\n\nWe want to find the values of $c$ such that there are exactly three real roots for $f(f(x))$. This means that there must be exactly one real root for the equation $f(x) = k^2 - 6k + c$. Since the vertex of the parabola $y = f(x)$ is $(-3, 9+c)$, there is exactly one real root for $f(x) = k^2 - 6k + c$ if and only if $9+c = k^2 - 6k + c$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = 3$.\n\nThus, the three distinct real roots of $f(f(x))$ are $r_1 = -6$, $r_2 = -3$, and $r_3 = 0$. Therefore, $f(-6) = f(-3) = f(0)$. Since $f(-3) = 9+c$, we have $c = f(0) - 9 = -9$. Thus, the only value of $c$ that works is $\\boxed{-9}$.\nThe answer is -9", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the vertex of the parabola $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$.\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{6}{2(1)} = -3$.\nThe $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $f(-3) = (-3)^2 + 6(-3) + c = -9 + c$.\nThe vertex is $(-3, -9 + c)$.\n\nNow, consider $f(f(x))$. Since $f(x)$ is a quadratic function, $f(f(x))$ is a quartic function.\nWe want $f(f(x))$ to have exactly $3$ distinct real roots.\n\nIn order for this to happen, $f(x)$ must have exactly one real root, say $r$.\nThis is because if $f(x)$ had two real roots, $f(f(x))$ would have at least $4$ real roots.\nSo, we want the vertex of $f(x)$ to lie on the $x$-axis, which means $-9 + c = 0$, and we get $c = 9$.\n\nFor this value of $c$, we have $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$.\nThe function $f(f(x))$ is then $(x^2 + 6x + 12)^2$, which indeed has exactly $3$ distinct real roots.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $c$ are $\\boxed{9}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the vertex of the parabola $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$. Completing the square, we get\n\\[f(x) = (x + 3)^2 + (c - 9).\\]\nSo the vertex is $(-3, c - 9)$. Since $f(x)$ is a parabola that opens upwards, the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $c - 9$.\n\nNow, we consider the function $f(f(x))$. We want this function to have exactly $3$ distinct real roots. This means that $f(x)$ must have exactly $3$ distinct real fixed points (i.e., points $x$ such that $f(x) = x$), since if $f(x) = x$, then $f(f(x)) = f(x) = x$.\n\nIf $f(x) = x$, then\n\\[x^2 + 6x + c = x.\\]\nRearranging, we get\n\\[x^2 + 5x + (c - 1) = 0.\\]\nFor this quadratic to have exactly $3$ distinct real roots, it must have exactly $2$ distinct real roots. This occurs when the discriminant is positive:\n\\[(5)^2 - 4(1)(c - 1) > 0.\\]\nSimplifying, we get\n\\[25 - 4c + 4 > 0,\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[c < \\frac{29}{4}.\\]\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that these roots are distinct. If the minimum value of $f(x)$ is less than the smallest root of $x^2 + 5x + (c - 1) = 0$, then the fixed points will be distinct. The smallest root of this quadratic is\n\\[\\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{5^2 - 4(c - 1)}}{2}.\\]\nSo we require\n\\[c - 9 < \\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{5^2 - 4(c - 1)}}{2}.\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $2$ and simplifying, we get\n\\[2c - 18 < -5 - \\sqrt{25 - 4c + 4}.\\]\nAdding $5$ to both sides, we get\n\\[2c - 13 < -\\sqrt{29 - 4c}.\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get\n\\[(2c - 13)^2 < 29 - 4c.\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\\[4c^2 - 52c + 169 < 29 - 4c.\\]\nRearranging, we get\n\\[4c^2 - 48c + 140 > 0.\\]\nFactoring, we get\n\\[4(c - 2)(c - 7) > 0.\\]\nSo, $c < 2$ or $c > 7$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we find that the possible values of $c$ are $c < 2$ or $7 < c < \\frac{29}{4}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Intermediate Algebra"}
