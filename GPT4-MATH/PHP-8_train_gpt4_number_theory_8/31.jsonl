This means that either $e_1 + 1 = 2$ and $e_2 + 1 = 6$, or $e_1 + 1 = 6$ and $e_2 + 1 = 2$. In the first case, $n = p_1^1p_2^5$, and in the second case, $n = p_1^5p_2^1$.

However, if $n = p_1^{11}$, then $n^{k/2} = (p_1^{11})^6 = p_1^{66}$, which is not of the form $3^6$. Thus, we must have $n = p_1^5 p_2$. In this case, $n^{k/2} = (p_1^5 p_2)^6 = p_1^{30} p_2^6$.
