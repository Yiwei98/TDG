Therefore, x is a multiple of 60.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of factors of x. If the prime factorization of x is $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\cdot \\dots$, then the number of factors of x is $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots$. Since x has 12 positive factors, we can write this as $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots = 12$. \n\nWe know that x is a multiple of 60, so its prime factorization must include $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$. To find the smallest possible value of x, we want to minimize the exponents in its prime factorization while still satisfying the condition that the number of factors is 12.\n\nWe can write 12 as a product of two factors in three ways: $1 \\cdot 12$, $2 \\cdot 6$, and $3 \\cdot 4$. Since we already have $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$ in the prime factorization, we can add more factors to satisfy one of these conditions. \n\n1. If we try $1 \\cdot 12$, we would need to add a factor of 11 to the prime factorization, which would give us $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 11^1$. However, this would give us 24 factors, not 12.\n\n2. If we try $2 \\cdot 6$, we can increase the exponent of 2 from 2 to 3, giving us $2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$. This would give us $(3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12$ factors, which is what we want.\n\n3. If we try $3 \\cdot 4$, we would need to add a factor of 7 to the prime factorization, which would give us $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1$. However, this would give us 48 factors, not 12.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of x is $2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{120}$.\nThe answer is 120.", "Let's think step by step\nSince 12 has 6 factors, and 15 has 4 factors, we can find the prime factorization of each number:\n$12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$ and $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$.\nSince 12 and 15 are both factors of x, x must have at least the prime factorization $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\nNow, let's find the number of factors for this number:\nThe number of factors is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12$.\nSince x has 12 factors, and $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$ also has 12 factors, x must be equal to $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\nTherefore, $x = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{60}$.\nThe answer is 60.", "Let's think step by step\nSince 12 and 15 are factors of x, we know that x is a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM). The prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^1$ and the prime factorization of 15 is $3^1 \\cdot 5^1$. Therefore, the LCM of 12 and 15 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 60$. So, x is a multiple of 60.\n\nNow, we know that x has 12 positive factors. The number of factors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization. Let x have the prime factorization $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$. Since x is a multiple of 60, we know that $a \\geq 2$, $b \\geq 1$, and $c \\geq 1$. \n\nThe number of factors of x is $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 12$. We consider the possible factorizations of 12: $1 \\cdot 12$, $2 \\cdot 6$, and $3 \\cdot 4$. We can eliminate the $1 \\cdot 12$ case, as this would require one of the exponents to be 11, which would make x much larger than necessary. \n\nFor the $2 \\cdot 6$ case, we have $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 2 \\cdot 6$. Without loss of generality, let $a+1 = 2$ and $b+1 = 6$. Then, $a=1$ and $b=5$. This gives us the prime factorization of x as $2^1 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^1$, and $x = 2 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5 = 4860$.\n\nFor the $3 \\cdot 4$ case, we have $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 3 \\cdot 4$. Without loss of generality, let $a+1 = 3$ and $b+1 = 4$. Then, $a=2$ and $b=3$. This gives us the prime factorization of x as $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^1$, and $x = 4 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 = 540$.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest possible value of x, the answer is $\\boxed{540}$."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory"}
