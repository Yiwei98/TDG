Thus, the smallest such positive integer $N$ is $\\boxed{189}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe know that the numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$ are consecutive integers, so one of them must be divisible by 2, one must be divisible by 3, and one must be divisible by 5. Since 2, 3, and 5 are primes, the only way for one of the numbers to be divisible by $2^2$, $3^2$, or $5^2$ is if the number is divisible by the square of the prime.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible remainders when dividing by $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, and $5^2=25$. We can have the following cases:\n\n1) $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}, N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}, N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$\n2) $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}, N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}, N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n3) $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}, N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}, N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$\n4) $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}, N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}, N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n5) $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}, N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}, N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$\n6) $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}, N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}, N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n\nWe can quickly eliminate cases 1 and 2 because they would require $N$ to be divisible by both 4 and 9, which is not possible since their least common multiple is 36. Similarly, we can eliminate cases 3 and 4 because they would require $N$ to be divisible by both 9 and 25, which is not possible since their least common multiple is 225.\n\nNow, we check cases 5 and 6. In case 5, we have $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, $N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, and $N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. The smallest such $N$ is 48. In case 6, we have $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, $N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, and $N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. The smallest such $N$ is 176. Since 48 is the smallest of these two values, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{48}$.\n\nNote: We have not yet used the condition that one of the numbers is divisible by $7^2=49$. However, we can easily check that in our solution, $N+1=49$ is indeed divisible by 49, so our answer is still valid.", "Let's think step by step\nSince the three numbers are consecutive, one of them must be divisible by 2, one of them must be divisible by 3, and one of them must be divisible by 5. We can eliminate the possibility of the middle number being divisible by 2, as it would then be odd and thus not divisible by 3 or 5. So either the first or the third number is divisible by 2.\n\nCase 1: The first number is divisible by 2.\nThen $N$ is divisible by $2^2 = 4$. Since $N+1$ is odd, it must be divisible by $3^2 = 9$. But then $N+2$ must be divisible by $5^2 = 25$, which is impossible since $N+2$ is even.\n\nCase 2: The third number is divisible by 2.\nThen $N+2$ is divisible by $2^2 = 4$. Since $N+1$ is odd, it must be divisible by $3^2 = 9$. So, $N$ must be divisible by $5^2 = 25$. However, we still need to account for the divisibility by $7^2 = 49$. Since $49$ and $25$ are relatively prime, we need to find the smallest multiple of $25$ that is one less than a multiple of $49$. This occurs when $N = 25\\cdot 3 = 75$, which is one less than $49\\cdot 2 = 98$. So, the smallest such $N$ is $\\boxed{75}$.\nThe answer is 75", "Let's think step by step\nWe have to find the smallest $N$ such that $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$ are divisible by $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, and either $5^2=25$ or $7^2=49$. We consider each case:\n\nCase 1: $N$ is divisible by $4$ and $N+1$ is divisible by $9$.\nIn this case, $N+2$ must be divisible by either $25$ or $49$.\nIf $N+2$ is divisible by $25$, then $N$ is divisible by $4$ and $N \\equiv 23 \\pmod{25}$.\nThe smallest such $N$ is $N = 23$.\nHowever, $N+1 = 24$ is not divisible by $9$.\nIf $N+2$ is divisible by $49$, then $N$ is divisible by $4$ and $N \\equiv 47 \\pmod{49}$.\nThe smallest such $N$ is $N = 92$.\nIn this case, $N+1 = 93$ is divisible by $9$, so this works.\n\nCase 2: $N$ is divisible by $9$ and $N+1$ is divisible by $4$.\nIn this case, $N+2$ must be divisible by either $25$ or $49$.\nIf $N+2$ is divisible by $25$, then $N$ is divisible by $9$ and $N \\equiv 22 \\pmod{25}$.\nThe smallest such $N$ is $N = 67$.\nHowever, $N+1 = 68$ is not divisible by $4$.\nIf $N+2$ is divisible by $49$, then $N$ is divisible by $9$ and $N \\equiv 46 \\pmod{49}$.\nThe smallest such $N$ is $N = 91$.\nIn this case, $N+1 = 92$ is divisible by $4$, so this works.\n\nComparing the two cases, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{91}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
