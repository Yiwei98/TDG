{"question": "For positive integers $n,$ let $\\tau (n)$ denote the number of positive integer divisors of $n,$ including 1 and $n.$ For example, $\\tau (1)=1$ and $\\tau(6) =4.$ Define $S(n)$ by $S(n)=\\tau(1)+ \\tau(2) + \\cdots + \\tau(n).$ Let $a$ denote the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ odd, and let $b$ denote the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ even. Find $|a-b|.$\n", "answer": "It is well-known that $\\tau(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is a perfect square. (Otherwise, we can group divisors into pairs whose product is $n$.) Thus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if there are an odd number of perfect squares less than $n$. So $S(1), S(2)$ and $S(3)$ are odd, while $S(4), S(5), \\ldots, S(8)$ are even, and $S(9), \\ldots, S(15)$ are odd, and so on.\nSo, for a given $n$, if we choose the positive integer $m$ such that $m^2 \\leq n < (m + 1)^2$ we see that $S(n)$ has the same parity as $m$.\nIt follows that the numbers between $1^2$ and $2^2$, between $3^2$ and $4^2$, and so on, all the way up to the numbers between $43^2$ and $44^2 = 1936$ have $S(n)$ odd. These are the only such numbers less than $2005$ (because $45^2 = 2025 > 2005$).\nNotice that the difference between consecutive squares are consecutively increasing odd numbers. Thus, there are $3$ numbers between $1$ (inclusive) and $4$ (exclusive), $5$ numbers between $4$ and $9$, and so on. The number of numbers from $n^2$ to $(n + 1)^2$ is $(n + 1 - n)(n + 1 + n) = 2n + 1$. Whenever the lowest square beneath a number is odd, the parity will be odd, and the same for even. Thus, $a = [2(1) + 1] + [2(3) + 1] \\ldots [2(43) + 1] = 3 + 7 + 11 \\ldots 87$. $b = [2(2) + 1] + [2(4) + 1] \\ldots [2(42) + 1] + 70 = 5 + 9 \\ldots 85 + 70$, the $70$ accounting for the difference between $2005$ and $44^2 = 1936$, inclusive. Notice that if we align the two and subtract, we get that each difference is equal to $2$. Thus, the solution is $|a - b| = |b - a| = |2 \\cdot 21 + 70 - 87| = \\boxed{25}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nWe first note that $\\tau(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is a perfect square.\nThis is because the divisors of $n$ can be paired up into groups of two with a product of $n$,\nexcept when $n$ is a perfect square, in which case there is one unpaired divisor (the square root of $n$).\nNow, we consider the parity of $S(n)$.\nIf $n$ is not a perfect square, then $\\tau(n)$ is even, so $S(n)$ has the same parity as $S(n-1)$.\nIf $n$ is a perfect square, then $\\tau(n)$ is odd, so $S(n)$ has the opposite parity as $S(n-1)$.\nThus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is the sum of an even number of perfect squares.\nWe now count the number of integers from 1 to 2005 that can be written as the sum of an even number of perfect squares.\nThe largest perfect square less than 2005 is $44^2 = 1936$, so we consider sums of the form $a^2 + b^2$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers between 1 and 44.\nThere are 22 such sums that are less than or equal to 2005:\n\\begin{align*}\n1^2 + 1^2 &= 2 \\\\\n1^2 + 2^2 &= 5 \\\\\n1^2 + 3^2 &= 10 \\\\\n2^2 + 2^2 &= 8 \\\\\n2^2 + 3^2 &= 13 \\\\\n2^2 + 4^2 &= 20 \\\\\n3^2 + 3^2 &= 18 \\\\\n3^2 + 4^2 &= 25 \\\\\n3^2 + 5^2 &= 34 \\\\\n4^2 + 4^2 &= 32 \\\\\n4^2 + 5^2 &= 41 \\\\\n4^2 + 6^2 &= 52 \\\\\n5^2 + 5^2 &= 50 \\\\\n5^2 + 6^2 &= 61 \\\\\n5^2 + 7^2 &= 74 \\\\\n6^2 + 6^2 &= 72 \\\\\n6^2 + 7^2 &= 85 \\\\\n6^2 + 8^2 &= 100 \\\\\n7^2 + 7^2 &= 98 \\\\\n7^2 + 8^2 &= 113 \\\\\n7^2 + 9^2 &= 130 \\\\\n8^2 + 8^2 &= 128\n\\end{align*}\nSince there are 2005 integers from 1 to 2005, we have $a = 22$ and $b = 2005 - 22 = 1983$.\nThus, $|a - b| = |22 - 1983| = \\boxed{1961}$.\nThe answer is 1961", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, note that $\\tau(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is a perfect square.\nThus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ has an odd number of perfect squares less than or equal to it.\nThe perfect squares less than or equal to 2005 are $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 44^2, 45^2$.\nThus, $S(n)$ is odd for $1^2 \\le n < 2^2$, $3^2 \\le n < 4^2$, $\\ldots$, $43^2 \\le n < 44^2$, and $45^2 \\le n \\le 2005$.\nThe number of such $n$ is $(2^2-1^2)+(4^2-3^2)+\\cdots+(44^2-43^2)+(2005-45^2+1)=a$.\nNow, $b=2005-a$, so $|a-b|=|2a-2005| = |2(44^2-43^2+1)-2005|=2(44-43)(44+43)-2005=87\\cdot2-2005=\\boxed{169}$.\nThe answer is 169", "Let's think step by step\nWe first notice that $\\tau(n)$ is even if and only if $n$ is a perfect square.\nSo, we are trying to find the difference between the number of positive integers $n\\leq 2005$ such that there is an odd number of perfect squares less than or equal to $n$, and the number of positive integers $n\\leq 2005$ such that there is an even number of perfect squares less than or equal to $n$.\nThere are 44 perfect squares less than or equal to 2005, so there are 44 numbers with an odd number of perfect squares less than or equal to them, and 2005-44 = 1961 numbers with an even number of perfect squares less than or equal to them.
