There are no multiples of 625 in this range.\n\nThus, there are a total of $398+79+15=492$ factorial tails less than 1992.

This is equal to the number of times 5 divides $m!$, since there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5. The number of times 5 divides $m!$ is given by the sum of the largest powers of 5 that divide $m!$, which is equal to $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m}{5}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{m}{25}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{m}{125}\\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\n\nWe want to find the largest $m$ such that the number of trailing zeroes is less than 1992. We can first find the largest power of 5 that divides $m!$ less than 1992 times. This occurs when $m = 5(1992) = 9960$. Now, we need to find the largest power of 25 that divides $m!$ less than 1992 times. This occurs when $m = 25(1992) = 4980$. Continuing this process, we find that the largest power of 125 that divides $m!$ less than 1992 times is when $m = 125(1992) = 2490$. Since the next power of 5 is 625, which is greater than 1992, we stop here.\n\nSo, the largest $m$ such that the number of trailing zeroes in $m!$ is less than 1992 is $m = 9960 + 4980 + 2490 = 17430$.

This means that $s$ and $l$ must have different parities (one is even, and the other is odd).\n\nSince $s + l = 54$, which is an even number, and $s$ and $l$ have different parities, one of them must be even. Since $s - l$ is odd, the even one must be $s$. So, $s$ is even, and $l$ is odd.\n\nNow, we want to maximize the number of large chips, which means we want to minimize the number of small chips.
