Since there are exactly three shared divisors, we can rule out 1 and 90 as common divisors because any number would have more than three shared divisors with 90 in that case.\n\nNow, let's consider the divisors of 90 that are products of two of its prime factors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, and 45. If any two of these were common divisors of 90 and m, then their least common multiple would also be a common divisor, which would give us more than three shared divisors. Thus, the three shared divisors must be 2, 3, and 5.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 5 are prime and are divisors of both 90 and m, then their product, which is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 30$, must also be a divisor of both numbers.
