If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even. Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$. If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$. This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes.

Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works. Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$.

The only perfect squares that satisfy this condition are $n^2 = 1$ and $n^2 = 4$.\n\nIf $n^2 = 1$, then $i = 1$. If $n^2 = 4$, then $i = 4$. Both of these values satisfy the given conditions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ integers $i$ that satisfy the given conditions.", "Let's think step by step\nThe given condition is $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$.\nSince $1$ and $i$ are always divisors of $i$, the sum of the remaining divisors of $i$ must be $\\sqrt{i}$.\nLet $d$ be a divisor of $i$ other than $1$ and $i$. Then, there is a corresponding divisor $\\frac{i}{d}$.\nSince $d$ and $\\frac{i}{d}$ are distinct divisors, their sum is $d+\\frac{i}{d} \\ge 2\\sqrt{d\\cdot\\frac{i}{d}} = 2\\sqrt{i}$.\nThus, there must be exactly one divisor $d$ of $i$ other than $1$ and $i$, and we must have $\\sqrt{i} = d+\\frac{i}{d}$.\nSquaring both sides and rearranging, we get $i = d^2 + 2d$.\nSince $d$ is a divisor of $i$, we have $d \\le \\sqrt{i}$. So, we have $i = d^2 + 2d \\le d^2 + 2d\\sqrt{i} \\le i$.\nThe first inequality shows that $i \\ge d^2 + 2d$, and the second inequality shows that $i \\le d^2 + 2d\\sqrt{i}$.\nSince $i \\le d^2 + 2d\\sqrt{i}$, we have $\\sqrt{i} \\le 2d$. So, $d \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{i}$.\nNow, we have $i \\ge d^2 + 2d \\ge d^2 + d\\sqrt{i} \\ge i$.\nThe first inequality shows that $i \\ge d^2 + d\\sqrt{i}$, and the second inequality shows that $i \\ge i$.\nSince $i \\ge d^2 + d\\sqrt{i}$, we have $\\sqrt{i} \\ge d$. So, $d \\le \\sqrt{i}$.\nCombining all the inequalities, we have $d = \\sqrt{i}$.\nSince $i = d^2 + 2d = d(d+2)$, we have $i = \\sqrt{i}(\\sqrt{i}+2)$.\nThus, $i$ must be a perfect square. Let $i = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Then, $k^2 = k(k+2)$, so $k = 0$ or $k = 2$.\nSince $1 \\le i \\le 2010$, we have $1 \\le k^2 \\le 2010$, so $k \\ge 1$.\nThus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ possible values of $i$: $i = 2^2 = 4$ and $i = 44^2 = 1936$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe see that $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ is the sum of the divisors of $i$,\nso $1, \\sqrt{i},$ and $i$ are the only divisors of $i$.\nThis means that $i$ must be a perfect square, so let $i = k^2$ for some positive integer $k$.\nNow we have $1, k,$ and $k^2$ as the only divisors of $k^2$.\nSince $k$ is a divisor of $k^2$, we have $k^2 = k \\cdot k'$ for some positive integer $k'$.\nIt follows that $k' = k$, so $k^2 = k^2$.\nThus, $i = k^2$ for some positive integer $k$, so the only possible values of $i$ are perfect squares.\nNow we just need to check the perfect squares less than or equal to 2010.\nThe perfect squares in this range are $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 44^2, 45^2$.\nChecking each of these, we find that the only perfect squares for which $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ are $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2, 10^2, 11^2, 12^2, 13^2, 14^2, 15^2, 16^2, 17^2, 18^2, 19^2, 20^2, 21^2, 22^2, 23^2, 24^2, 25^2, 26^2, 27^2, 28^2, 29^2, 30^2, 31^2, 32^2, 33^2, 34^2, 35^2, 36^2, 37^2, 38^2, 39^2, 40^2, 41^2, 42^2, 43^2, 44^2$.\nThere are $\\boxed{44}$ such integers.\nThe answer is 44"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
