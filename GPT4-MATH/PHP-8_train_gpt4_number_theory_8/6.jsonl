If we had 10 1s the smallest binary number would be: $$1111111111_2=1023$$ This is greater than 1000, so the greatest possible cost when sending with option 2 will be 9.  We can look at the largest numbers less than 1000 which cost 9 with Option 1 and see if they cost 9 with option 2.  The largest numbers are: $$900,810,801,720,711,702,...$$ The smallest possible number with 10 digits and cost 9 in Option 2 is: $$1011111111_2=767$$ Below this, we would have: $$111111111_2=511$$ which doesn't work.  We can quickly check the numbers above and see that they cost less than 9 with method 2.  So, we now need to consider numbers with cost of 8.  The largest numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 1 are: $$800,710,701,620,611,602,530,521,512,503,...$$ It is possible to check these in base 2 and see which is the first to cost 8 with Option 2, or we can go the other way and look at numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 2.  Either way, we will find the largest possible integer with a cost of 8 is: $$111110111_2 = 503$$ We must check and make sure that there are no numbers larger than $503$ with an Option 2 cost lower than 8. The numbers with cost 7 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $700$, $610$, $601$, and $520$. We can check that all cost less than 7 in Option 2 and can be eliminated. The numbers with cost 6 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $600$ and $510$, neither of which have cost 6 in Option 2 and therefore do not work.

Then, the cost of transmitting $n$ in base 10 is $a + b + c$.\n\nNow, let's consider the cost of transmitting $n$ in base 2. Since $n < 1000$, it can be represented by a binary number with at most 10 digits. The largest power of 2 less than 1000 is $2^9 = 512$, so the binary representation of $n$ will have a leading 1 in the $2^9$ place. The remaining 9 digits will be a mix of 0s and 1s.\n\nThe cost of transmitting $n$ in base 2 will be the number of 1s in its binary representation. Since we want the costs of both options to be equal, we have:\n\n$a + b + c = \\text{number of 1s in the binary representation of } n$\n\nWe want to maximize $n$, so we should maximize the number of 1s in its binary representation. The maximum number of 1s we can have is 9 (if all the remaining digits are 1s). In this case, we have:\n\n$a + b + c = 9$\n\nTo maximize $n$, we should maximize its leftmost digit, $a$. The maximum value of $a$ is 9, so we have:\n\n$9 + b + c = 9$\n\nThis gives us $b + c = 0$. Since $b$ and $c$ are digits, the only possible values are $b = 0$ and $c = 0$.

So, the cost is at most 10.\n\nNow, we want to find the largest integer for which the costs are equal, so we want to maximize $a+b+c$ while keeping it less than or equal to 10.\nThe largest possible value for $a$ is 9 (since the integer is less than 1000), so we want to maximize $b+c$ while keeping it less than or equal to 1 (since $a+b+c \\leq 10$).\nThe largest possible value for $b$ is 9, which leaves $c=1-9=-8$. However, $c$ must be non-negative, so the largest possible value for $c$ is 0. In this case, $b=1$ and $a=9$.\n\nSo, the largest integer that costs the same using either option is $910$. The answer is 910.", "Let's think step by step\nWe want to find the largest integer $n$ such that the sum of its digits in base 10 is equal to the sum of its digits in base 2.\nLet $n = 100a + 10b + c$ be a three-digit number, where $a, b, c$ are its digits.\nThen the cost of Option 1 is $a + b + c$.\n\nNow let's convert $n$ to binary. Since $n < 1000$, the largest power of 2 less than 1000 is $2^9 = 512$.\nIf $a \\ge 2$, then $n \\ge 2 \\cdot 100 = 200 > 512$, which is not possible. Therefore, $a = 1$.\n\nNow, we have $n = 100 + 10b + c$, and in binary, it starts with $1$ followed by the binary representation of $10b + c$.\nThe largest possible value for $10b + c$ is $99$, which in binary is $1100011$. Therefore, the largest possible binary representation of $n$ is $11100011$.\n\nThe cost of Option 2 is the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. In this case, the cost is $5$.\n\nNow we want to find the largest integer $n$ such that $a + b + c = 1 + b + c = 5$.\nThe largest possible value for $b$ is $4$, which makes $c = 0$. Thus, the largest integer $n$ is $100 + 4 \\cdot 10 + 0 = 140$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer less than 1000 that costs the same whether using Option 1 or Option 2 is $\\boxed{140}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe want to find the largest integer $x$ such that the cost of sending its digits is equal to the cost of sending its binary representation.\nLet $d$ be the number of digits in $x$.

If $x$ has $d$ digits, then $10^{d-1} \\le x < 10^d$. Converting to binary, we have $2^{3(d-1)} \\le x < 2^{3d}$, since $10 \\approx 2^3$. This means that the binary representation of $x$ has between $3(d-1)+1$ and $3d$ digits, inclusive.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest integer $x$ for which the costs are equal, we want to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation. Therefore, we want the binary representation to have $3d$ digits, all of which are 1s. This corresponds to the integer $2^{3d}-1$.\n\nNow we compare the costs. We have $9d \\ge 3d$, which simplifies to $d \\ge 3$. Since we want the largest integer less than 1000, we consider the case where $d=3$. In this case, $x = 2^{3\\cdot3}-1 = 2^9-1 = 511$.\n\nChecking the costs, we see that sending 511 using Option 1 costs $5+1+1=\\$7$, and sending 511 using Option 2 costs $9\\cdot\\$1=\\$9$.
