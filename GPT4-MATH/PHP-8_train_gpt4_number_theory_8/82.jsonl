{"question": "The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n", "answer": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nLet $n$ be the total number of members in the band.\nSince there are 5 members left over when arranged in a square formation, $n = k^2 + 5$ for some integer $k$.\nNow, the director arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns. Let the number of columns be $c$, then the number of rows is $c+7$.\nSince there are no members left over, $n = c(c+7)$.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get $k^2 + 5 = c(c+7)$.\nExpanding and rearranging, we get $k^2 - c(c+7) = -5$.\nSince $k^2$ and $c(c+7)$ are both non-negative, we want to find the smallest possible positive difference between them.\nWe can start by trying different values of $k$ and finding the corresponding $c$ values.\nFor $k=1$, we have $c(c+7)=0$, which means $c=0$ or $c=-7$. Neither of these values are valid since we need a non-empty formation.\nFor $k=2$, we have $c(c+7)=1$, which has no integer solutions for $c$.\nFor $k=3$, we have $c(c+7)=4$, which has no integer solutions for $c$.\nFor $k=4$, we have $c(c+7)=11$, which has no integer solutions for $c$.\nFor $k=5$, we have $c(c+7)=20$, which has integer solutions $c=3$ and $c=4$.\nSo the smallest valid value of $k$ is 5, and the corresponding value of $c$ is 3.\nThus, the maximum number of members in the band is $n = k^2 + 5 = 5^2 + 5 = \\boxed{30}$.\nThe answer is 30.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $n$ be the number of members in the marching band. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over, so $n = k^2 + 5$ for some integer $k$. The director can also arrange the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, so $n = x(x+7)$ for some integer $x$. \n\nWe can substitute $k^2 + 5$ for $n$ in the second equation: $k^2 + 5 = x(x+7)$. Rearranging the equation, we get $k^2 - x^2 = 7x - 5$. Factoring the left side as a difference of squares, we get $(k-x)(k+x) = 7x - 5$. \n\nSince $k$ and $x$ are both integers, both factors on the left side are integers. We want to find the maximum possible value of $n$, so we want to maximize $k$ and $x$. The right side of the equation, $7x - 5$, is increasing as $x$ increases. So, we want to find the smallest possible value for one of the factors on the left side, which will minimize the other factor and maximize $x$. \n\nThe smallest possible value for one of the factors on the left side is 1. If we let $k-x = 1$, then $k = x+1$. Substituting this back into the equation, we get $(x+1)(2x+1) = 7x - 5$. Expanding and rearranging, we get $x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0$. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that $x = 2 + \\sqrt{10}$ or $x = 2 - \\sqrt{10}$. Since $x$ must be an integer, we take the first solution, $x = 2 + \\sqrt{10}$. Then, $k = x + 1 = 3 + \\sqrt{10}$. \n\nNow we can find the number of members, $n = k^2 + 5 = (3 + \\sqrt{10})^2 + 5 = 14 + 6\\sqrt{10} + 5 = 19 + 6\\sqrt{10}$. Since $n$ must be an integer, we know that $6\\sqrt{10}$ must be an integer.

Rearranging, we get $k^2 - c^2 = 7c - 5$.\nFactoring the left side, we have $(k + c)(k - c) = 7c - 5$.\nSince $k$ and $c$ are integers, both factors $(k + c)$ and $(k - c)$ are integers.\nWe want to maximize the number of members in the band, so we want to maximize $n = k^2 + 5$.\nIf we maximize $k$, then $k - c$ will be smaller, so we should try to minimize $k - c$.\nThe smallest possible value of $k - c$ is 1. In this case, we have $(k + c) = 7c - 5$ and $k - c = 1$.\nSolving this system of equations, we get $k = 4c - 4$ and $c = 3$.\nTherefore, $k = 4(3) - 4 = 8$.\nNow, we can find the number of members in the band: $n = k^2 + 5 = 8^2 + 5 = 64 + 5 = \\boxed{69}$.\nThe maximum number of members is 69.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $n$ be the number of members in the band.\nIf they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over, so $n = k^2 + 5$ for some positive integer $k$.\nThe director then arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, so $n = (c+7)c$ for some positive integer $c$.\n\nNow we have the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &= k^2 + 5 \\\\\nn &= c(c+7)\n\\end{align*}\n\nSetting the two expressions for $n$ equal, we get $k^2 + 5 = c(c+7)$, or $k^2 - c^2 = 7c - 5$.\nFactoring the left side as a difference of squares, we have $(k+c)(k-c) = 7c - 5$.\n\nSince $k$ and $c$ are both positive integers, we can look for factors of $7c - 5$ to find possible values for $k+c$ and $k-c$. Note that $k+c > k-c$, so we want to find the largest possible value of $k+c$.\n\nTrying some possible values of $c$, we find that when $c=3$, we have $7c-5=16$, which is a factorization of $(k+c)(k-c)$. This gives us $k+c=16$ and $k-c=1$, so $k=8$ and $c=7$.

When arranged in a rectangular formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over: $n = x(x+7)$.\n\nFrom (1), we have $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$. This is because the only perfect squares $\\pmod{6}$ are 0, 1, and 4, so $n = k^2 + 5$ must be 1, 2, or 5 $\\pmod{6}$, and the only one of these that is 0 $\\pmod{7}$ is 5. Thus, $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{42}$.\n\nNow, we will search for possible values of $n$ which satisfy these conditions. We will start by trying the largest possible value of $n$ less than 1000, which is $n = 42 \\cdot 23 + 5 = 971$. This yields $k = 31$, which does not work since $k^2 + 5 = 966 \\neq 971$. Thus, we try the next smallest value, $n = 42 \\cdot 22 + 5 = 929$. This yields $k = 30$, which works since $k^2 + 5 = 900 + 5 = 905$.
