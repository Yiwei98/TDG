Then the reversed integer is $5000 + 100c + 10b + a$. Since $m$ and its reversed integer are both divisible by 9, their digit sums must also be divisible by 9. That is, $a + b + c + 5$ and $5 + a + b + c$ are both divisible by 9. Combining these two expressions, we have $2(a+b+c)+10$ is divisible by 9, which means $a+b+c$ is divisible by 9.\n\nSince $m$ is divisible by 7, we have $1000a + 100b + 10c + 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.

Then the integer obtained by reversing the digits of m is 1000d + 100c + 10b + a. Since m is divisible by 5, either a or d must be 5 or 0. However, since m is a four-digit integer, a cannot be 0.

The maximum sum of the digits that is divisible by 9 is 18, so b + c + d = 13.\n\nSince m is divisible by 315, we want the largest possible value of m.
