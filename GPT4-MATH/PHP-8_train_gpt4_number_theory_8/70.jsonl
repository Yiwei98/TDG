Since $6 \\times 10 = 60$, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{60}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThe least positive odd multiple of 3 is 3 itself. The next odd multiple of 3 is 3 + 6 = 9. In general, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ odd multiple of 3 is $3 + 6(n - 1)$. We want to find the tenth odd multiple of 3, so we plug in $n = 10$ to get $3 + 6(10 - 1) = 3 + 6(9) = 3 + 54 = \\boxed{57}$.\nThe answer is 57", "Let's think step by step\nWe are looking for the tenth positive integer that is odd and a multiple of 3, which means it is a multiple of both 3 and 2 (since it's odd) - in other words, it's a multiple of 6.\nThe first few positive multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60.\nSo, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{60}$."], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory"}
