Thus, the largest integer divisor of the expression must be divisible by 5.\n\nNow, let's consider divisibility by 7:\n- If $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, then $n+1$ is not divisible by 7, but $n+7$ is divisible by 7.\n- If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, then $n+1$ is divisible by 7, and $n+7$ is not divisible by 7.\n- If $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, then $n+1$ is not divisible by 7, but $n+3$ is divisible by 7.\nIn all cases, exactly one of the factors is divisible by 7. Thus, the largest integer divisor of the expression must be divisible by 7.\n\nSince 3, 5, and 7 are all prime, the largest integer divisor of the expression must be divisible by their product, which is $3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 105$.\n\nNow, we need to show that 105 is indeed a divisor of the expression for all positive even integers $n$. We can do this by checking the cases when $n$ is a multiple of 2, 6, and 10:\n- If $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, then $n+1$ is odd, $n+3$ is divisible by 3, $n+5$ is divisible by 5, and $n+7$ is divisible by 7.\n- If $n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$, then $n+1$ is divisible by 7, $n+3$ is divisible by 3, $n+5$ is divisible by 5, and $n+9$ is odd.\n- If $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{10}$, then $n+1$ is odd, $n+3$ is divisible by 7, $n+5$ is divisible by 5, and $n+9$ is divisible by 3.\nIn all cases, the product $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ is divisible by 105.\n\nThus, the largest integer that is a divisor of the given expression for all positive even integers $n$ is $\\boxed{105}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we note that the expression is a product of five consecutive odd integers.\nIf $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd, and so is each of the other four factors.\nSince the factors are consecutive odd integers, at least one of them is divisible by 3 and at least one is divisible by 5.\nThus, the expression is always divisible by $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$.\n\nNow, we show that 15 is the largest such integer.\nIf $n = 2$, then the expression is $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 11$.\nThis is divisible by 15, but not by any larger multiple of 15.\nTherefore, the largest integer that is a divisor of the expression for all positive even integers $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$.", "Let's think step by step\nSince $n$ is even, we can write $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
