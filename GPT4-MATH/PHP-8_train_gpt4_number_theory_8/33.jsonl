{"question": "The $24^\\text{th}$ day of a particular month is a Saturday. On what day of the week was the first day of that month?", "answer": "If the $24$th is a Saturday, the $17$th was also a Saturday, as were the $10$th and the $3$rd.  So the $2$nd was a Friday and the $1$st was a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nSince the 24th day is a Saturday, we can count backwards by weeks (7 days) to find the day of the week for the 1st day of that month.\nThe 17th day would also be a Saturday (24 - 7 = 17).\nThe 10th day would also be a Saturday (17 - 7 = 10).\nThe 3rd day would also be a Saturday (10 - 7 = 3).\nNow, we only have to go back 2 more days to reach the 1st day of the month.\nSo, the 1st day of the month would be two days before Saturday, which is a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.\nThe answer is Thursday", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 23 days between the first day of the month and the 24th day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 23 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days are between these two dates.\n23 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 2.\nThis means there are 3 full weeks and 2 extra days between the first day of the month and the 24th day, which is a Saturday.\nTo find the day of the week for the first day of the month, we go back 2 days from Saturday.\nGoing back 2 days from Saturday, we get $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.\nThe answer is Thursday", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 23 days between the first day of the month and the 24th day.\nDividing 23 by 7, we get a remainder of 2.\nThis means that the first day of the month is 2 days before Saturday, which is $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.\nThe answer is Thursday", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 23 days between the first day of the month and the $24^\\text{th}$ day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we find the remainder when 23 is divided by 7, which is 2.\nThus, we go back 2 days from Saturday to find the day of the week for the first day of the month.\nGoing back 2 days from Saturday, we have Friday and then Thursday.\nSo, the first day of the month was a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 23 days between the 1st and the 24th day of the month.\nDividing 23 by 7, we get a remainder of 2.\nThis means that the first day of the month is 2 days before the 24th day, which is a Saturday.\nSo, the first day of the month is on a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 23 days between the 1st day of the month and the 24th day.\nDivide 23 by 7 to find the number of weeks and the remainder: $23 \\div 7 = 3$ with a remainder of $2$.\nSince the 24th day is a Saturday, we can go back two days to find the day of the week for the 1st day of the month.\nSo, two days before Saturday is $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe know that the $24^\\text{th}$ day of the month is a Saturday.\nNow, we work backwards to find the day of the week for the first day of the month.\nTo do this, we subtract multiples of 7 from 24 until we reach a number between 1 and 7.\n24 - 21 = 3\nSo, the third day of the month is a Saturday.\nNow, we can work backward two more days to find the first day of the month:\nFriday is the second day of the month, and Thursday is the $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$ first day of the month.", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 23 days between the 1st day of the month and the 24th day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we can find the remainder when 23 is divided by 7, which is 2.\nThis means that the first day of the month is 2 days before Saturday.\nTherefore, the first day of the month was a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory"}
