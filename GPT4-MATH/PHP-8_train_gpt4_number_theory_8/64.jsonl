Then, $k = 5m + 2$ for some integer $m$, and $n = 4(5m + 2) + 1 = 20m + 9$.\n\nSubstituting into the third congruence, we get $20m + 9 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $6m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get $36m \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$, or $m \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. Hence, $m = 7p + 6$ for some integer $p$, and $n = 20(7p + 6) + 9 = 140p + 129$.\n\nThe smallest possible value of $n$ is $140(0) + 129 = \\boxed{129}$.\nThe answer is 129.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $n$ be the number of students in the class.\nFrom the given information, we have the following congruences:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}, \\\\\nn &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}, \\\\\nn &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the first congruence, $n = 4a + 1$ for some integer $a$. Substituting into the second congruence, we get $4a + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Thus, $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, so $a = 5b + 4$ for some integer $b$. Therefore, $n = 4(5b + 4) + 1 = 20b + 17$.\n\nSubstituting into the third congruence, we get $20b + 17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $6b \\equiv -14 \\pmod{7}$. Since $6 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$, we have $b \\equiv 14 \\pmod{7}$, so $b = 7c + 2$ for some integer $c$.
