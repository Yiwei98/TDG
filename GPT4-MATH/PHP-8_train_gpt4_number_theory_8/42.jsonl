Since 9 divides $10!$ once, the largest power of 9 that divides $10!$ is $9^1$. Therefore, $10!$ ends in one zero when written in base 9.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "Let's think step by step\nTo find the number of zeroes that $10!$ ends with in base 9, we want to find the highest power of 9 that divides $10!$. We do this by finding the number of factors of 3 in $10!$, since 9 is a power of 3. \nThe factors of 3 in $10!$ come from the numbers 3, 6, and 9. There are three factors of 3 in these numbers (3 has one factor of 3, 6 has one factor of 3, and 9 has two factors of 3). However, we need two factors of 3 to make a factor of 9. Therefore, we can form $\\frac{3}{2} = 1$ factor of 9 in $10!$. \nThus, $10!$ ends with $\\boxed{1}$ zero when written in base 9."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Number Theory"}
