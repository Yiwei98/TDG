There are 10 integers with each possible non-zero digit in the tens place and 9 in the ones place.\nThus, the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from 1 to 100 is $S_2 = 10S_1 + 9S_1 = 19S_1 = \\frac{149625}{2520}$.\nSimilarly, the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from 1 to 1000 is $S_3 = 100S_1 + 90S_1 = 190S_1 = \\frac{1496250}{2520}$.\nNotice that the numerator of $S_3$ is divisible by 2520, so $S_3$ is an integer.\nThus, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $S_n$ is an integer is $\\boxed{3}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe are looking for the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from $1$ to $10^n$ inclusive.

There are 10 of each non-zero digit in the tens place and 9 of each non-zero digit in the units place (since we're excluding 0).
