Since consecutive integers cannot both be squares, this case yields no solutions. If one of them is $4$, then $n$ or $n+1$ must be the cube of a prime, and the other must be $3$. This leads to the solutions $(n,n+1) = (8,9), (26,27)$. Thus, the sum of the six least positive integers $n$ that are solutions to $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ is $2+3+4+6+8+26=\\boxed{49}$.\nThe answer is 49", "Let's think step by step\nThe only way to have $\\tau(n)+\\tau(n+1)=7$ is if one of the numbers $n$ or $n+1$ has exactly 4 divisors and the other has exactly 3 divisors.\nSince 3 is prime, one of the numbers must be a square of a prime, and the other must be twice a prime.\nIf $n=p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n+1=2q$ for some prime $q$.\nIf $n=2q$ for some prime $q$, then $n+1=p^2$ for some prime $p$.\nIn both cases, we have $n=p^2-1=(p-1)(p+1)$ or $n=2q-1$.\nWe consider each case separately.\n\nCase 1: $n=(p-1)(p+1)$\nSince $p-1$ and $p+1$ are consecutive even integers, one of them is divisible by 4.\nIt follows that $n$ is divisible by 8, so $n\\ge 8$.\nThe smallest such $n$ is $n=(3-1)(3+1)=8$.\nThe next smallest is $n=(5-1)(5+1)=24$.\n\nCase 2: $n=2q-1$\nIn this case, $n+1=2q$ is even, so $n$ is odd.\nThe smallest such $n$ is $n=2(3)-1=5$.\nThe next smallest is $n=2(5)-1=9$, but this is not the product of consecutive integers.\nThe next smallest is $n=2(7)-1=13$.\nThe next smallest is $n=2(11)-1=21$.\n\nThus, the six smallest positive integers $n$ are 5, 8, 13, 21, 24, and 34.\nTheir sum is $5+8+13+21+24+34=\\boxed{105}$.", "Let's think step by step\nIf $\\tau (n) + \\tau (n+1) = 7,$ then either $\\tau (n) = 1$ and $\\tau (n+1) = 6,$ or $\\tau (n) = 2$ and $\\tau (n+1) = 5,$ or $\\tau (n) = 3$ and $\\tau (n+1) = 4.$\n\nIf $\\tau (n) = 1,$ then $n = 1,$ but this does not work, since then $\\tau (n+1) = \\tau (2) = 2.$\n\nIf $\\tau (n) = 2,$ then $n$ is prime.
