Also, since $f(f(n))$ is the sum of divisors of $f(n)$, it must be at least $f(n)+1$.\nNow, let $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$.

This inequality holds for all primes $p_i \\geq 3$ and their powers. However, for $p_i=2$, the inequality holds only if $a_i \\geq 2$.

Then $n=2^a3^b$ for some $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$. We have $f(n)=(2^{a+1}-1)(3^{b+1}-1)/2$. Since $f(n)$ is an integer, either $2^{a+1}-1$ or $3^{b+1}-1$ must be divisible by 2. As $3^{b+1}-1$ is always even, we must have $2^{a+1}-1$ odd, which implies $a=1$. So, $n=2^13^b$.\n\nNow, we have $f(n)=3(3^{b+1}-1)$ and $f(f(n))=n+2=6\\cdot3^b$.
