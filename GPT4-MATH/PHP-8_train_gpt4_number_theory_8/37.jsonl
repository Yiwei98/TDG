The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \\cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$. Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$.

In this case, we can write $b = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting into the equation $2a + 3b = 8$, we get $2a + 6k = 8$. Dividing by 2, we have $a + 3k = 4$. Since $a$ and $k$ are integers, their sum is also an integer, so 2 must be a divisor of $2b + 12$.\n- If 3 is a divisor, then $b + 6$ must be a multiple of 3. Substituting $b = 3k$ into the equation $2a + 3b = 8$, we get $2a + 9k = 8$. Rearranging, we have $2a = 8 - 9k$.

If $2b + 12$ is divisible by 3, then $20 - 3b - 2a$ is divisible by 3. Since $20$ is not divisible by 3, either $3b$ or $2a$ must be divisible by 3. We are given that $3b = 8 - 2a$, so $3b$ is not divisible by 3. Therefore, $2a$ must be divisible by 3, which means that $a$ must be divisible by 3.

Since $3$ is a divisor of $3b$, it follows that $3$ must also be a divisor of $8 - 2a$. This means that $2a$ is one less than a multiple of $3$. The only possible values for $2a$ that are one less than a multiple of $3$ and less than $8$ are $2$ and $5$. If $2a = 2$, then $a = 1$ and $b = 2$. If $2a = 5$, there is no integer solution for $a$.

From the equation $2a + 3b = 8$, we see that this is possible (for example, when $b=1$ and $a=2$). So, it is not necessary for $2b + 12$ to be divisible by 3.\n3. If $2b + 12$ is divisible by 4, then $2b \\equiv -12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which means $b$ is a multiple of 2. From the equation $2a + 3b = 8$, we see that this is possible (for example, when $b=2$ and $a=1$). So, it is not necessary for $2b + 12$ to be divisible by 4.\n4. If $2b + 12$ is divisible by 5, then $2b \\equiv -12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which means $b$ is a multiple of 5. From the equation $2a + 3b = 8$, we see that this is not possible, as the smallest value of $b$ that is a multiple of 5 is $b=5$, but then $2a + 15 > 8$. So, $2b + 12$ must be divisible by 5.\n5. If $2b + 12$ is divisible by 6, then $2b \\equiv -12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$, which means $b$ is a multiple of 3. As we discussed in case 2, this is not necessary.\n\nThus, out of the first six positive integers, only 1, 2, and 5 must be divisors of $2b + 12$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Number Theory"}
