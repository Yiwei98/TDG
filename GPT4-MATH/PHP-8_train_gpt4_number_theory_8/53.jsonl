{"question": "How many integers $N$ less than $1000$ can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers from exactly 5 values of $j\\ge 1$?\n", "answer": "Let the first odd integer be $2n+1$, $n\\geq 0$. Then the final odd integer is $2n+1 + 2(j-1) = 2(n+j) - 1$. The odd integers form an arithmetic sequence with sum $N = j\\left(\\frac{(2n+1) + (2(n+j)-1)}{2}\\right) = j(2n+j)$. Thus, $j$ is a factor of $N$.\nSince $n\\geq 0$, it follows that $2n+j \\geq j$ and $j\\leq \\sqrt{N}$.\nSince there are exactly $5$ values of $j$ that satisfy the equation, there must be either $9$ or $10$ factors of $N$. This means $N=p_1^2p_2^2$ or $N=p_1p_2^4$. Unfortunately, we cannot simply observe prime factorizations of $N$ because the factor $(2n+j)$ does not cover all integers for any given value of $j$.\nInstead we do some casework:\nIf $N$ is odd, then $j$ must also be odd. For every odd value of $j$, $2n+j$ is also odd, making this case valid for all odd $j$.

Substituting $j=2k$, we get\n\\[N = 4k(n+k) \\Longrightarrow \\frac{N}{4} = k(n+k)\\]\nNow we can just look at all the prime factorizations since $(n+k)$ cover the integers for any $k$.

Then, there are 5 factors of $m^2$ that are less than or equal to $m$, which means $m^2$ has exactly 10 factors. Therefore, $m$ is either a product of two distinct primes or a prime cubed.\n\nIf $m = p^3$ for some prime $p$, then $m^2 = p^6$ which has 7 factors, not 10. So, $m = pq$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Then, $m^2 = p^2q^2$ has 9 factors, so we need one of $p$ or $q$ to be equal to 2. Without loss of generality, let $p=2$.
