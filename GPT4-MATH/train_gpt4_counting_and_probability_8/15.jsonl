{"question": "If 2 cards from a standard deck are selected randomly, what is the probability that either two kings or at least 1 ace occurs? (There are 4 Aces, 4 kings and 52 total cards in a standard deck.)", "answer": "We clearly can't have both two kings and at least 1 ace, so we have two exclusive cases to evaluate separately.\n\nCase 1: Two kings. The probability that two kings are drawn is $\\frac{4}{52} \\cdot \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{221}$.\n\nCase 2: At least 1 ace.  We can break this into two cases:\n\nSubcase 2A: Exactly 1 ace.  We can choose the ace first with probability $\\frac{4}{52}\\cdot \\frac{48}{51}$, and we can choose the ace last with probablity $\\frac{48}{52} \\cdot \\frac{4}{51}$.  So, the total probability of getting exactly one ace is $2\\cdot\\frac{48}{52}\\cdot\\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{32}{221}$.\n\nSubcase 2B: 2 aces.  The probability of this occurring is the same as that of two kings, $\\frac{1}{221}$.\n\nSo, the total probability for Case 2 is $\\frac{33}{221}$.\n\nAdding this to our probability for Case 1, we have $\\frac{34}{221} =\\boxed{ \\frac{2}{13}}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the probability of selecting two kings. There are 4 kings in the deck, so the probability of selecting a king on the first draw is $\\frac{4}{52}$. After drawing one king, there are 3 kings left and 51 cards remaining in the deck, so the probability of selecting a king on the second draw is $\\frac{3}{51}$. Thus, the probability of selecting two kings is $\\frac{4}{52} \\cdot \\frac{3}{51}$.\n\nNext, we find the probability of selecting at least 1 ace. The complementary event is selecting no aces, so we will find the probability of that event and subtract it from 1. There are 48 cards that are not aces, so the probability of selecting a non-ace on the first draw is $\\frac{48}{52}$. After drawing one non-ace, there are 47 non-aces left and 51 cards remaining in the deck, so the probability of selecting a non-ace on the second draw is $\\frac{47}{51}$. Thus, the probability of selecting no aces is $\\frac{48}{52} \\cdot \\frac{47}{51}$, and the probability of selecting at least 1 ace is $1-\\left(\\frac{48}{52} \\cdot \\frac{47}{51}\\right)$.\n\nNow we need to find the probability of either two kings or at least 1 ace occurring. Since these events are mutually exclusive (they cannot both happen at the same time), we can simply add their probabilities: $\\left(\\frac{4}{52} \\cdot \\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(1-\\left(\\frac{48}{52} \\cdot \\frac{47}{51}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get: $\\frac{12}{2652} + \\frac{2652-2256}{2652} = \\frac{12+396}{2652} = \\frac{408}{2652}$.\n\nFinally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12: $\\frac{408}{2652} = \\frac{34}{221}$.\n\nSo the probability that either two kings or at least 1 ace occurs is $\\boxed{\\frac{34}{221}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThere are three cases to consider: two kings, one ace and one non-king, and two aces.\n\nCase 1: Two kings\nThere are 4 kings in the deck, so the probability of drawing two kings is $\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{221}$.\n\nCase 2: One ace and one non-king\nThere are 4 aces and 44 non-kings (52 cards minus 4 aces and 4 kings) in the deck.

There are 44 cards that are not kings or aces (52 - 4 aces - 4 kings). So, the probability of selecting one such card is 44/52. After selecting one such card, there are 43 cards left that are not kings or aces, and 51 total cards remaining. So, the probability of selecting another such card is 43/51.\n\nThus, the probability of the complementary event is (44/52) * (43/51).\n\nNow, we find the probability of the event we are interested in (either two kings or at least 1 ace) by subtracting the probability of the complementary event from 1:\n\n1 - (44/52) * (43/51) = 1 - (44*43)/(52*51) = 1 - (1892/2652) = (760/2652).\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get the probability as $\\boxed{\\frac{95}{331}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThere are three cases to consider: \n1.

One card is an ace, and the other card is not a king.\n\nFor case 1, there are 4 kings to choose from for the first card, and 3 kings to choose from for the second card, so there are 4*3 = 12 ways to choose two kings out of the 52 cards. Since the order of the cards doesn't matter, we need to divide by 2 to account for overcounting, so there are 12/2 = 6 ways to choose two kings.\n\nFor case 2, there are 4 aces to choose from for the first card, and 3 aces to choose from for the second card, so there are 4*3 = 12 ways to choose two aces out of the 52 cards.
