{"question": "Ben twice chooses a random integer between 1 and 50, inclusive (and he may choose the same integer both times). What is the probability that at least one of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3?", "answer": "There are 16 multiples of 3 between 1 and 50 ($1\\cdot 3$ through $16\\cdot 3$), and $50-16=34$ numbers which are not multiples of 3. The probability that neither of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $\\left( \\frac{34}{50} \\right)^2=\\frac{1156}{2500}$.
