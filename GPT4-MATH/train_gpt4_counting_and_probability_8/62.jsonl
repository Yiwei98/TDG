This only happens if he buys the two cheapest toys, costing 25 cents and 50 cents. There are 6 ways to arrange the first three toys (including the favorite one), and only 1 of those arrangements has the two cheapest toys first. So, the probability in this case is $\\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{42}$.\n\nIn all other cases (when the favorite toy is selected fourth or later), Sam will have spent at least 75 cents and will not need to get change.\n\nSo, the total probability that Sam has to get change is $\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{5}{42} = \\frac{12}{42} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{2}{7}.", "Let's think step by step\nSam has 8 quarters, which is equivalent to $2.00$. His favorite toy costs $1.75$, so he can buy it without getting change if it is one of the first two toys offered to him. \nThere are 8 toys in total, so the probability that his favorite toy is not one of the first two offered is $\\frac{6}{8}\\times\\frac{5}{7}=\\frac{30}{56}=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{28}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{15}{28}."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
