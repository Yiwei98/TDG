{"question": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?", "answer": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.

The next smallest multiple of 7 is 7*141 = 987, which ends in 3.\n\nNow, we note that every 10th multiple of 7 will end in 3 because adding 70 to a multiple of 7 that ends in 3 will result in another multiple of 7 that ends in 3 (e.g., 21 + 70 = 91, 91 + 70 = 161, and so on).\n\nSo, we want to find the number of multiples of 7 between 21 and 987, inclusive, that are 10 multiples apart.
