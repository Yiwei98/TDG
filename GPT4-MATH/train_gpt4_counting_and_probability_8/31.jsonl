{"question": "Let $N$ be the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $2003$ and whose base-$2$ representation has more $1$'s than $0$'s. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n", "answer": "In base-$2$ representation, all positive numbers have a leftmost digit of $1$. Thus there are ${n \\choose k}$ numbers that have $n+1$ digits in base $2$ notation, with $k+1$ of the digits being $1$'s.\nIn order for there to be more $1$'s than $0$'s, we must have $k+1 > \\frac{d+1}{2} \\Longrightarrow k > \\frac{d-1}{2} \\Longrightarrow k \\ge \\frac{d}{2}$. Therefore, the number of such numbers corresponds to the sum of all numbers on or to the right of the vertical line of symmetry in Pascal's Triangle, from rows $0$ to $10$ (as $2003 < 2^{11}-1$). Since the sum of the elements of the $r$th row is $2^r$, it follows that the sum of all elements in rows $0$ through $10$ is $2^0 + 2^1 + \\cdots + 2^{10} = 2^{11}-1 = 2047$. The center elements are in the form ${2i \\choose i}$, so the sum of these elements is $\\sum_{i=0}^{5} {2i \\choose i} = 1 + 2 +6 + 20 + 70 + 252 = 351$.\nThe sum of the elements on or to the right of the line of symmetry is thus $\\frac{2047 + 351}{2} = 1199$.

We can do this because the base-2 representation of the integers between 256 and 1983 all start with 1, so if we change the leading digit to 0, we get the base-2 representation of an integer between 0 and 1727. There are 128 integers between 0 and 1727 with more 1's than 0's, so there are 1728 - 128 = 1600 integers between 256 and 1983 with more 0's than 1's.\n\nAdding the number of integers with more 0's than 1's for each case, we get 1 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 13 + 19 + 1600 = 1653.
