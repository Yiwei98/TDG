A spacy set can have none of them, any one of them, exactly two of them, or exactly three of them. If it has two of them, they must be one of the following pairs: $\\{1, 3\\}$, $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{2, 4\\}$, $\\{2, 5\\}$, $\\{3, 5\\}$. If it has three of them, they must be $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$. Thus there are 12 spacy subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nNow consider the 6 integers $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. A spacy set can have none of them, any one of them, exactly two of them, exactly three of them, or exactly four of them. If it has two of them, they must be one of the following pairs: $\\{1, 3\\}$, $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{2, 4\\}$, $\\{2, 5\\}$, $\\{3, 5\\}$, $\\{3, 6\\}$. If it has three of them, they must be one of the following sets: $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$, $\\{1, 3, 6\\}$, $\\{1, 4, 6\\}$, $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$. If it has four of them, they must be $\\{1, 3, 5, 6\\}$. Thus there are 20 spacy subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\nWe can continue this pattern to find the number of spacy subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 12\\}$. The pattern is $1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 20, \\dots$. We can see that the pattern increases by 2 each time. So, the number of spacy subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 12\\}$ is $1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 12 + 20 + 30 + 42 + 56 + 72 + 90 + 110 = \\boxed{345}$.\nThe answer is 345", "Let's think step by step\nConsider the integers modulo 3. \nWe can have at most 4 integers congruent to 1 modulo 3, at most 4 integers congruent to 2 modulo 3, and at most 4 integers congruent to 0 modulo 3.\nThus, there are $5^3=\\boxed{125}$ spacy sets, since we can have 0 to 4 integers of each residue class modulo 3.\nThe answer is 125", "Let's think step by step\nConsider the integers from 1 to 12.
