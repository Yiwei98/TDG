Three odd rolls and one even roll: There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose which die rolls the even number. The probability of this happening is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$ for each choice, so the total probability for this case is $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n3. Five odd rolls and one even roll: This case is impossible since we are only rolling four dice.\n\nThus, the probability that the sum is odd given that at least one die rolled an even number is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{16}{15} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nThe product of the four dice is even if at least one of the dice shows an even number. The probability that a single die shows an even number is $1/2$, so the probability that all four dice show odd numbers is $(1/2)^4 = 1/16$. Thus, the probability that at least one die shows an even number is $1 - 1/16 = 15/16$.\n\nFor the sum to be odd, there must be an odd number of odd dice. There are three cases to consider: 1 odd die and 3 even dice, 3 odd dice and 1 even die, or 5 odd dice and 0 even dice (which is not possible since we already know at least one die is even).\n\nCase 1: There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a single die is odd, and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a single die is even. So the probability of having 1 odd die and 3 even dice is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{16}$, and there are 4 ways to arrange the odd die among the four dice, so the total probability for this case is $\\frac{1}{16} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nCase 2: The probability of having 3 odd dice and 1 even die is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{16}$, and there are 4 ways to arrange the even die among the four dice, so the total probability for this case is $\\frac{1}{16} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince there is a $15/16$ probability that the product is even, the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is the sum of the probabilities for the two cases divided by the probability that the product is even: $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{16}{15} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{8}{15}.", "Let's think step by step\nThe product of the dice values will be even if at least one of the dice rolls an even number.\nThe probability that a single die rolls an even number is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that a single die rolls an odd number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability that all four dice roll odd numbers is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$, so the probability that at least one die rolls an even number is $1-\\frac{1}{16}=\\frac{15}{16}$.\nNow, given that at least one die rolls an even number, we want to find the probability that the sum of the dice is odd.\nIf the sum of the dice is odd, then there must be an odd number of odd numbers rolled.\nThere are two cases: either exactly one die rolls an odd number or exactly three dice roll odd numbers.\n\nCase 1: Exactly one die rolls an odd number.\nThere are 4 ways to choose which die rolls the odd number, and for each choice, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that the chosen die rolls an odd number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that each of the other three dice rolls an even number.\nSo the probability of this case is $4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nCase 2: Exactly three dice roll odd numbers.\nThere are 4 ways to choose which die rolls the even number, and for each choice, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that the chosen die rolls an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that each of the other three dice rolls an odd number.\nSo the probability of this case is $4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe total probability that the sum of the dice is odd, given that at least one die rolls an even number, is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the probability that the product is even and the sum is odd is $\\frac{15}{16}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{15}{32}.", "Let's think step by step\nThe product of the four dice is even if and only if at least one of the dice shows an even number.\nThe probability that a single die shows an even number is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that all four dice show odd numbers is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$.\nTherefore, the probability that at least one die shows an even number is $1-\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}$.\n\nNow, if at least one die shows an even number, the sum of the four dice will be odd if and only if an odd number of the dice show odd numbers.\nThere are $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways for one die to show an odd number and the other three to show even numbers, and there are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways for three dice to show odd numbers and one to show an even number.\nThus, there are a total of $4+4=8$ ways for the sum to be odd when at least one die shows an even number.\n\nSince there are a total of $2^4 = 16$ possible outcomes for the dice rolls when considering only odd and even numbers, the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is $\\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFinally, to find the overall probability that the product is even and the sum is odd, we multiply the probability that the product is even by the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even: $\\frac{15}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.\n\nThe answer is \\frac{15}{32}."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
