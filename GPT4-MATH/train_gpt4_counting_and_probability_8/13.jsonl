{"question": "A game show offers a contestant three prizes A, B and C, each of which is worth a whole number of dollars from $$ 1$ to $$ 9999$ inclusive.

If 2 diagonals intersect inside the heptagon, they must share a common endpoint. There are 7 vertices in the heptagon, and from each vertex, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs of diagonals that intersect inside the heptagon. So there are a total of $7\\cdot 6=42$ pairs of intersecting diagonals.\n\nThus, the probability that 2 diagonals chosen at random intersect inside the heptagon is $\\frac{42}{91}=\\boxed{\\frac{14}{30}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{14}{30}"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
