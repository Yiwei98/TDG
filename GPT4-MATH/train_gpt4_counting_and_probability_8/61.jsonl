answer is $m + n = \\boxed{802}$.\nThe answer is 802", "Let's think step by step\nLet $W$, $L$, and $T$ denote the number of wins, losses, and ties, respectively.\nSince Club Truncator plays 6 matches, we have $W + L + T = 6$.\nWe want to find the probability that $W > L$.\nThere are a total of $3^6$ possible outcomes.\n\nWe can proceed with casework on the number of ties Club Truncator has:\n\nCase 1: $T = 0$. Then $W = 4$ and $L = 2$, so there are $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 2: $T = 1$. Then $W = 4$ and $L = 1$, so there are $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 3: $T = 2$. Then $W = 3$ and $L = 1$, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 4: $T = 3$. Then $W = 2$ and $L = 1$, so there are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 5: $T = 4$. Then $W = 1$ and $L = 1$, so there are $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 6: $T = 5$. Then $W = 1$ and $L = 0$, so there are $\\binom{6}{5} = 6$ outcomes in this case.\n\nThus, the probability that Club Truncator will finish the season with more wins than losses is $\\frac{15 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6}{3^6} = \\frac{77}{243}$, so the answer is $m + n = \\boxed{320}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
