We can do this by finding the interval of $x$ for which $11^2 \\le P(x) < 12^2$, or $121 \\le x^2 - 3x - 9 < 144$. Solving these inequalities, we get $13 \\le x < \\frac{49}{4}$.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that $\\lfloor\\sqrt{P(x)}\\rfloor = \\sqrt{P(\\lfloor x \\rfloor)}$. The total length of the intervals for which this condition holds is $\\frac{11}{2} - 5 + \\frac{19}{3} - \\frac{11}{2} + \\frac{49}{4} - 13 = \\frac{11}{12}$.\n\nSince the total length of the interval $5 \\le x \\le 15$ is $10$, the probability is $\\frac{\\frac{11}{12}}{10} = \\frac{\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{49} - 4}{120}$, and the answer is $11 + 12 + 49 + 4 + 120 = \\boxed{196}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's look at the inequality $\\lfloor\\sqrt{P(x)}\\rfloor = \\sqrt{P(\\lfloor x \\rfloor)}$. We can rewrite this as $\\lfloor\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 9}\\rfloor = \\sqrt{\\lfloor x \\rfloor^2 - 3\\lfloor x \\rfloor - 9}$.\nNow, consider the interval $5 \\le x \\le 15$. For any $x$ in this interval, we have $5 \\le \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le 15$. Thus, we can analyze the function $P(x) = x^2 - 3x - 9$ for $5 \\le x \\le 15$.\nWe can rewrite $P(x)$ as $P(x) = (x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{45}{4}$, which is a parabola with its vertex at $(\\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{45}{4})$. Since the vertex is below the x-axis, the function is non-negative for some values of $x$. We can find the range of $x$ for which $P(x) \\ge 0$ by solving $(x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{45}{4} \\ge 0$. This inequality simplifies to $(x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 \\ge \\frac{45}{4}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $|x - \\frac{3}{2}| \\ge \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. This inequality holds for $x \\le \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ or $x \\ge \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nSince we are only interested in the interval $5 \\le x \\le 15$, we only need to consider the second part of the inequality: $x \\ge \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. This inequality holds for $x \\ge 6.7082\\dots$.\nNow, we can count the number of integers $x$ in the interval $[6.7082\\dots, 15]$ that satisfy the original inequality. There are 9 integers in this interval: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen $x$ from the interval $5 \\le x \\le 15$ satisfies the inequality is $\\frac{9}{15 - 5} = \\frac{9}{10}$. In the desired form, this is $\\frac{\\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{0} - (-9)}{10}$, so $a + b + c + d + e = 0 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 10 = \\boxed{19}$.\nThe answer is 19"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
