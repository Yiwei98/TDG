In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games.

With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games. Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.\nThe desired probability is thus $\\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$.

There are three faces adjacent to two of the A-faces, which we will call B-faces, and one face adjacent to the three B-faces, which we will call the C-face.\nClearly, the labels for the A-faces must come from the set $\\{3,4,5,6,7\\}$, since these faces are all adjacent to $1$.

Only 2(8) is not consecutive with any of the others, so it goes on the C-face. 1 possibility.\n2378: None of the numbers can go on the C-face because they will be consecutive with one of the B-face numbers.
