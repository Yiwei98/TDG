Notice that $8=10-2$ and $12=10+2$. Then notice that the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$ is, by the binomial theorem, $\\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$. Similarly, the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10-2)^{25}$ is, by the binomial theorem, $\\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot (-2)^k = (-1)^k \\cdot \\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$, which is the same as the $k^{th}$ term of $(10+2)^{25}$ for $k$ even, and the negative of the $k^{th}$ term of $(10+2)^{25}$ for $k$ odd. So, if we add together the $k^{th}$ terms of the expansions of $(10-2)^{25}$ and $(10+2)^{25}$, we get double the value of the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$, that is, $2 \\cdot \\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$, if $k$ is even, and 0 if $k$ is odd.
