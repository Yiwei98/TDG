Since $k+1$ and $k-1$ are factors of $a$, $a$ must be even. Thus, $k+1$ must be even and $k-1$ must be odd. Let $k+1 = 2m$. Then, $k-1 = 2m - 2$. So, $a = (k+1)(k-1) = 2m(2m-2) = 4m^2 - 4m$. Then, $p = 2 + a + 2b = 2 + 4m^2 - 4m + 4(k+1) = 4m^2 - 4m + 6$. We want $p < 2015$, so $4m^2 - 4m + 6 < 2015$. We can divide by $4$ to get $m^2 - m + 1.5 < 503.75$. We can see that the largest possible value of $m$ is $22$, which gives us $p = 2010$. Since $m$ is an integer, there are $\\boxed{22}$ possible values of $m$, and thus $22$ possible values of $p$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ABD$, we have $b^2 + (b + 2)^2 = d^2$. Rearranging and factoring, we get $(2b - d)(d + b + 2) = 4$. Since $b$ and $d$ are positive integers, we consider the following cases for the factors of 4:\n\nCase 1: $(2b - d) = 1$ and $(d + b + 2) = 4$\nSolving this system of equations, we get $b = 1$ and $d = 3$.

Then, $BD = y - x$. By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangles $ABC$ and $ABD$, we have \\[x^2 + 4 = y^2 - 2xy + x^2 \\implies y^2 - 2xy + 4 = 0.\\] Thus, we have \\[y = x + \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}.\\] Since $y$ is an integer, $x^2 - 4$ must be a perfect square. Let $x^2 - 4 = k^2 \\implies x^2 - k^2 = 4 \\implies (x + k)(x - k) = 4$. Since $x$ and $k$ have the same parity, both $x + k$ and $x - k$ are even. Thus, the only possibility is $(x + k, x - k) = (4, 1) \\implies (x, k) = (3, 2), (5, 4), \\cdots, (1005, 1004)$. There are $\\boxed{502}$ such pairs, but we only want the ones with $p = x + 2 + y < 2015$. For each of the $502$ pairs, $p = 2x + 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 4}$, so we want \\[2x + 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 4} < 2015 \\implies x < 1007 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}.\\] Note that the function $f(x) = 1007 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}$ is strictly decreasing, so we can just find the largest $x$ such that the inequality is satisfied. For $(x, k) = (1005, 1004)$, we have $p = 2010$, so the inequality is not satisfied. For $(x, k) = (1003, 1002)$, we have $p = 2006$, so the inequality is satisfied. Thus, there are $502 - 1 = \\boxed{501}$ possible values of $p$. However, we made a mistake in assuming that $x$ and $k$ have the same parity. This is not necessarily true, since we could have $x = 2n + 1, k = 2n - 1$ for some positive integer $n$. In this case, we have $(x + k, x - k) = (4n, 2) \\implies (x, k) = (2n + 1, 2n - 1)$. Thus, we have $x^2 - 4 = (2n - 1)^2 \\implies x = \\sqrt{4n^2 - 4n + 5}$. However, we see that $4n^2 - 4n + 5 = (2n - 1)^2 + 4$, so $\\sqrt{4n^2 - 4n + 5}$ is never an integer.

Then, by the Pythagorean theorem on $\\triangle ABD$, we have $x^2+(y-2)^2=y^2$, which simplifies to $x^2=4y-4$. We know that $x$ must be even, so let $x=2z$. Then, we have $4z^2=4y-4$. It follows that $y=z^2+1$. Since the perimeter is $p=2+x+y+z^2<2015$, we have $z^2<2013$. The largest possible perfect square less than $2013$ is $44^2=1936$, so the largest possible value of $z$ is $44$.

Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $a^2$, we get $x^2 + 4 + x^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$, or $x^2 - 4x = 0$. Thus, $x(x - 4) = 0$, so $x = 4$ since $x$ must be positive.
