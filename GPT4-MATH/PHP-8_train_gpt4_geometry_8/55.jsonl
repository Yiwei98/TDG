Solving for $H$, we get $H = 25$.\n\nNow, we have $\\frac{a}{A} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{b}{B} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we have $\\frac{1}{2}ab = 6$, which means $ab = 12$.\n\nThe area of the larger triangle is 150 square inches, so $\\frac{1}{2}AB = 150$, which means $AB = 300$. Since $\\frac{a}{A} = \\frac{1}{5}$, we have $A = 5a$. Similarly, since $\\frac{b}{B} = \\frac{1}{5}$, we have $B = 5b$. Thus, $AB = 25ab = 300$, which means $ab = 12$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the smaller triangle and $ab = 12$, we can substitute $A = 5a$ and $B = 5b$ to find the sum of the legs of the larger triangle: $A+B = 5a + 5b = 5(a+b)$. Since $ab = 12$, we have $a+b = \\frac{12}{a} + a$. Substituting this into the expression for $A+B$, we get $A+B = 5\\left(\\frac{12}{a} + a\\right) = \\frac{60}{a} + 5a$.\n\nNow we want to find the smallest possible value of $A+B$. To do this, we can consider the function $f(a) = \\frac{60}{a} + 5a$ and find its minimum value. Since $f'(a) = -\\frac{60}{a^2} + 5$, we can set $f'(a) = 0$ to find the critical points: $-\\frac{60}{a^2} + 5 = 0$. Solving for $a$, we get $a^2 = \\frac{60}{5} = 12$, so $a = \\sqrt{12}$.\n\nPlugging this value of $a$ back into the expression for $A+B$, we get $A+B = \\frac{60}{\\sqrt{12}} + 5\\sqrt{12} = 10\\sqrt{3} + 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{20\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe answer is 20\\sqrt{3}.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the legs of the smaller triangle be $a$ and $b$, and let the legs of the larger triangle be $c$ and $d$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the larger triangle, we have $c^2 + d^2 = 25^2 = 625$. \n\nNow, we know that $c = 5a$ and $d = 5b$, so we can substitute these expressions into the equation: $(5a)^2 + (5b)^2 = 625$.

Dividing both sides by 25, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 25$. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the smaller triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find that $a^2 + b^2 = 5^2 = 25$. This confirms that our equation is correct.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the legs of the larger triangle: $c + d = 5a + 5b = 5(a + b)$. We don't have the exact values of $a$ and $b$, but we know that $a^2 + b^2 = 25$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, we know that $a + b > 0$.
