We know that the sidelength of the inner hexagon is 6 since $\\overline{DE}$ consists of the radii of two small circles. We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle. There are now several approaches to solving the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon. Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\\overline{CE}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon. So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{DE}$ bisects $\\angle C$ and $\\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{6}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. Each right triangle has a leg of length $\\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\\circ$). That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\\cdot3=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\\triangle CED$ and $\\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{180^\\circ (6-2)}{6}=\\frac{180^\\circ \\cdot4}{6}=30^\\circ \\cdot4=120^\\circ$. That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\\circ$. All three angles equal $60^\\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle. Then we know that $CD=DE=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$ (see other approaches for how). That means $m\\angle D=m\\angle E$ and $m\\angle D+ m\\angle E=120^\\circ$. Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$ each. We continue the rest of approach 2 after proving that triangle $CED$ is equilateral.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\npair A=(3,0), B=(1.5, 2.598), C=(0,0), D=(-1.5, 2.598), E=(-3,0), F=(-1.5, -2.598), G=(1.5, -2.598);\npair H=(2,0), I=(1, 1.732), J=(-1, 1.732), K=(-2,0), L=(-1, -1.732), M=(1, -1.732);\npath f1=A--B--D--E--F--G--cycle;\npath f2=H--I--J--K--L--M--cycle;\ndraw(f2);\ndraw(f1);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(C--(H+I)/2);\npen sm=fontsize(10);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NE, sm); label(\"B\", B, NE, sm); label(\"C\",C,W, sm);\nlabel(\"D\", H, NE, sm); label(\"E\", I, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"$6$\", (H+I)/2, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"$3$\", (A+H)/2, S, sm);\n[/asy]", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nConsider the hexagon formed by the centers of the small circles,\nwhich is a regular hexagon with side length 6 units.\nThe diameter of the large circle is the distance between opposite vertices of this hexagon.\nTo find this distance, we can divide the hexagon into 12 equilateral triangles with side length 3 units each.\nThe diameter of the large circle is equal to the sum of the side lengths of 4 of these equilateral triangles,\nwhich is $4 \\times 3 = \\boxed{12}$ units.\nThe answer is 12", "Let's think step by step\nLet $O$ be the center of the large circle and $A$ and $B$ be the centers of two neighboring small circles.\nThen, $AB=6$ and $OA=OB=r$, the radius of the large circle.\nLet $C$ be the point where the two small circles are tangent.\nThen, $\\angle ACB=120^{\\circ}$ because the centers of the three circles form an equilateral triangle.\nNow, consider triangle $OAB$.\nSince $\\angle OAB=120^{\\circ}$, we have $\\angle AOB=180^{\\circ}-120^{\\circ}=60^{\\circ}$.\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nr^2 &= OA^2+OB^2-2(OA)(OB)\\cos(\\angle AOB) \\\\\n&= r^2+r^2-2r^2\\cos(60^{\\circ}) \\\\\n&= 2r^2-r^2 \\\\\n&= r^2\n\\end{align*}\nSo, $r^2=AB^2=6^2=36$.\nThus, $r=6$ and the diameter of the large circle is $2r=\\boxed{12}$ units.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $O$ be the center of the large circle, and let $A$ and $B$ be the centers of two neighboring small circles.\nThen $\\triangle OAB$ is equilateral with side length $6$, so the diameter of the large circle is $2\\cdot OA = \\boxed{12}$ units.", "Let's think step by step\nWe draw a hexagon with vertices at the centers of the small circles.
