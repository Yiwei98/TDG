Each semicircle has an area of (1/2)\u03c0(1^2) = \u03c0/2 square inches. Since there are 6 semicircles, their total area is 6(\u03c0/2) = 3\u03c0 square inches.\n\nSubtracting the area of the semicircles from the area of the entire 1-foot length, we get 24 - 3\u03c0 square inches for the area of the shaded region. So, the answer is $\\boxed{24 - 3\\pi}$ square inches.", "Let's think step by step\nThe area of the shaded region is the area of the large semicircle with diameter 24'' minus the area of the small semicircles.\nThere are 12 small semicircles, each with diameter 2''.\nThe area of the large semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(12)^2=72\\pi$ square inches.\nThe area of each small semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(1)^2=\\frac{1}{2}\\pi$ square inches.\nThus, the area of the shaded region is $72\\pi - 12\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi\\right) = \\boxed{66\\pi}$ square inches.\nThe answer is 66\\pi", "Let's think step by step\nThere are 6 semi-circles of diameter 2 inches in 1 foot (12 inches) of this pattern.\nThe area of each semi-circle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ square inches, since the radius is 1 inch.\nThus, the area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of this pattern is $6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\boxed{3\\pi}$ square inches.\nThe answer is 3\\pi", "Let's think step by step\nThere are $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$ semicircles of diameter 2'' in a 1-foot length.\nThe area of each of these semicircles is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(1^2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi$ square inches.\nTherefore, the total area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length is $6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi\\right) = \\boxed{3\\pi}$ square inches.\nThe answer is 3\\pi."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Geometry"}
