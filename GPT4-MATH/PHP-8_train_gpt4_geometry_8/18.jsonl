By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $h^2 + (s/2)^2 = (11-s)^2$, and the area of the triangle is $(1/2)sh$. \n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the triangle, so we find the derivative of the area with respect to $s$ and set it equal to zero. To simplify the process, we instead maximize the square of the area, which is $A^2 = s^2h^2/4$. Substituting for $h^2$ from the Pythagorean theorem, we have $A^2 = s^2((11-s)^2 - (s/2)^2)/4$. \n\nTaking the derivative with respect to $s$, we get $\\frac{dA^2}{ds} = -2s^3 + 33s^2 - 121s$.

What is the criterion for this statement to be true?\nWe consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from $A$. It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.\nNow, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle.

We have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$. Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly let $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$. Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$.\nAs $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.\nFurther, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.\nLastly, we apply the formula:\\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)} = \\sin \\angle AOM \\cos \\angle BOM - \\sin \\angle BOM \\cos \\angle AOM = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{7}{25}\\]Thus the answer is $7\\cdot25=\\boxed{175}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $F$ be the intersection of $AD$ and $BC$.

It follows that $\\sin \\angle AOB = \\sin (\\angle AOC - \\angle BOC) = \\frac{2x}{5}-\\frac{2y}{5}=\\frac{2(x-y)}{5}$. Since $x+y+z=10$ and $y+z=6$, we have $x-y=4$, so $\\sin \\angle AOB = \\frac{8}{5}$. Thus, the product $mn$ is $\\boxed{40}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the center of the circle be $O$, and let $F$ be the midpoint of $AD$.\nLet $x=AF=FD$ and $y=FB$.\nThen $AC=5-x$ and $CD=5+x$.\nWe have $BC=6$ and $BF=y$.\nBy the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABO$, we have \\[AB^2=25+25-50\\cos \\angle ABO\\] and by the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABO$, we have \\[AB^2=25+25-50\\cos \\angle ABO.\\] Since $AB=AC+CB+BD$, we have \\[AB^2=(5-x+6+y+5+x)^2=(11+y)^2.\\] Thus \\[\\sin^2 \\angle ABO=\\frac{25-11^2}{25}=\\frac{36}{25}.\\] Since $AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ which is bisected by $BC$, it follows that $\\angle ABO$ must be the minimum angle for which $\\sin^2 \\angle ABO$ is rational. Therefore, $\\angle ABO=30^\\circ$, so $\\sin \\angle ABO=\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{3}{5}$ and the answer is $3\\cdot 5=\\boxed{15}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can find that $\\angle ABO=30^\\circ$ by using coordinates. Let $A=(0,5)$, $O=(0,0)$, $B=(a,b)$, and $C=(-a,b)$. Then $AB=AC=5$ and $BC=6\\sqrt{2}$. Using the distance formula, we have \\[a^2+b^2=25\\] and \\[a^2+(b-5)^2=25.\\] Subtracting these equations gives $b=3$, so $a=4$ and $\\sin \\angle ABO=\\frac{3}{5}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}
