Suppose $P$ is the apex of the tetrahedron, and let $O$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\\triangle ABC$. The crux of this problem is the following lemma.\nLemma: The point $O$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nProof. Observe that\\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$. Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, $AO$ is perpendicular to $FE$ and hence $BC$. Analogously, $O$ lies on the $B$-altitude and $C$-altitude of $\\triangle ABC$, and so $O$ is, indeed, the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nTo find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$. The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\\frac{3}{4} x$. These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.\nLet $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\\triangle BPQ$. From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$. However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.\nThe area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\\frac{102*12}{3}=\\boxed{408}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the midpoint triangle:\nMidpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(34,0)$: $(17,0)$\nMidpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(16,24)$: $(8,12)$\nMidpoint of $(34,0)$ and $(16,24)$: $(25,12)$\n\nNow, let's label the vertices of the midpoint triangle as follows:\n$A = (17,0)$\n$B = (8,12)$\n$C = (25,12)$\n\nWe can compute the area of the triangle $ABC$ using the Shoelace Theorem, or by finding the length of the base and the height:\nBase $AC = 25 - 8 = 17$\nHeight from $B$ to $AC = 12$\n\nSo, the area of triangle $ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 17 \\cdot 12 = 102$.\n\nNow, let's find the height of the pyramid. We can do this by finding the distance between the centroid of the original triangle and the plane formed by the midpoint triangle.\nThe coordinates of the centroid of the original triangle are:\n$G = \\left( \\frac{0+34+16}{3}, \\frac{0+0+24}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{50}{3}, 8 \\right)$\n\nNow, we find the equation of the plane formed by triangle $ABC$. To do this, we can first find two vectors in the plane:\n$\\vec{AB} = \\langle -9, 12 \\rangle$\n$\\vec{AC} = \\langle 8, 12 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we find the normal vector of the plane by taking the cross product of these two vectors:\n$\\vec{N} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} = \\langle 216, 72, 216 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the plane as $216x + 72y + 216z = D$. To find $D$, we can substitute the coordinates of any point in the plane (for example, point $A$):\n$216(17) + 72(0) + 216(0) = D \\Rightarrow D = 3672$\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is $216x + 72y + 216z = 3672$.\n\nNow, we find the distance between the centroid $G$ and the plane. The distance between a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and a plane $Ax + By + Cz = D$ is given by:\n$D = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 - D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}$\n\nIn our case, $x_0 = \\frac{50}{3}$, $y_0 = 8$, and $z_0 = 0$, so we have:\n$D = \\frac{|216\\left(\\frac{50}{3}\\right) + 72(8) - 3672|}{\\sqrt{216^2 + 72^2 + 216^2}}$\n\nAfter simplifying, we get $D = \\frac{50}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula:\n$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\text{base area} \\cdot \\text{height}$\n\nSo, $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 102 \\cdot \\frac{50}{3} = \\boxed{1700}$.\nThe answer is 1700", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the vertices of the midpoint triangle. The midpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(34,0)$ is $(17,0)$, the midpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(16,24)$ is $(8,12)$, and the midpoint of $(34,0)$ and $(16,24)$ is $(25,12)$. So, the midpoint triangle has vertices $(17,0)$, $(8,12)$, and $(25,12)$.\n\nNow, we will find the lengths of the sides of the midpoint triangle. Using the distance formula, we find that the length of the side connecting $(17,0)$ and $(8,12)$ is $\\sqrt{(17-8)^2+(0-12)^2}=15$, the length of the side connecting $(17,0)$ and $(25,12)$ is $\\sqrt{(17-25)^2+(0-12)^2}=15$, and the length of the side connecting $(8,12)$ and $(25,12)$ is $\\sqrt{(8-25)^2+(12-12)^2}=17$. Thus, the midpoint triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 15 and hypotenuse of length 17.\n\nNow, let's fold the triangle along the sides of the midpoint triangle to form the triangular pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the midpoint triangle, and the apex of the pyramid is the vertex of the original triangle that is not a vertex of the midpoint triangle, which is $(0,0)$.\n\nTo find the volume of the pyramid, we need to find the area of the base and the height. The area of the base, which is the midpoint triangle, can be found using the formula for the area of a right triangle: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot base \\cdot height = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15 = 112.5$.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the pyramid, which is the perpendicular distance from the apex $(0,0)$ to the plane containing the base. To do this, we find the equation of the plane containing the base (the midpoint triangle) and then find the distance from the point $(0,0,0)$ to this plane.\n\nThe equation of the plane can be found using the point-normal form. We know that the normal vector to the plane is perpendicular to the base, so it will be perpendicular to the two legs of the midpoint triangle. The direction vectors of these legs are $\\langle 9, -12, 0 \\rangle$ and $\\langle -8, 12, 0 \\rangle$. Taking the cross product of these vectors, we find the normal vector to be $\\langle 0, 0, 180 \\rangle$. So, the equation of the plane containing the base is of the form $180z = D$.\n\nNow, we substitute one of the vertices of the midpoint triangle, say $(17,0,0)$, into the equation to find the value of $D$. We get $180(0) = 17D$, so $D=0$. Thus, the equation of the plane is $180z=0$, or simply $z=0$.\n\nThe height of the pyramid is the distance from the apex $(0,0,0)$ to the plane $z=0$, which is simply 0. Therefore, the height of the pyramid is 0.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot baseArea \\cdot height$. The volume is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 112.5 \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is 0", "Let's think step by step\nThe vertices of the midpoint triangle are $(0,0)$, $(25,12)$, and $(17,12)$.\nLet $A = (0,0)$, $B = (34,0)$, $C = (16,24)$, $M = (25,12)$, and $N = (17,12)$.\nWhen we fold the triangle along the sides of its midpoint triangle, the vertices $B$ and $C$ are identified.\nLet $P$ be the vertex opposite $A$ in the triangular pyramid,\nso $P$ is the image of $B$ and $C$ after folding.\n\nLet $h$ be the height of the pyramid from $P$ to base triangle $AMN$.\nWe will find the area of triangle $AMN$ and then use the volume formula $\\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base.\n\nFirst, we find the area of triangle $AMN$ using the Shoelace Theorem:\n\\[\\text{Area}(AMN) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|(0)(12) + (25)(12) + (17)(0) - (12)(17) - (0)(25) - (12)(0)\\right| = 144.\\]\n\nNext, we find the height $h$ from $P$ to base $AMN$. Note that $P$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of segment $BC$, which is also the perpendicular bisector of segment $MN$. Let $Q$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Then, $Q = \\left(\\frac{34+16}{2}, \\frac{24+0}{2}\\right) = (25,12) = M$. Therefore, $PM$ is the height from $P$ to base $AMN$.\n\nNow, we find the length of $PM$. By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ABC$,\n\\[AC^2 = AB^2 - BC^2 = 34^2 - 10^2 = 24^2.\\]\nThis means that $AC = 24$. Since $AM = \\frac{1}{2} AC = 12$, we have $PM = \\sqrt{AC^2 - AM^2} = \\sqrt{24^2 - 12^2} = 12\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, we find the volume of the pyramid:\n\\[\\text{Volume} = \\frac{1}{3}Bh = \\frac{1}{3}(144)(12\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{576\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\n\nThe answer is 576\\sqrt{3}.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the vertices of the midpoint triangle.\nThe midpoint of the side connecting $(0,0)$ and $(34,0)$ is $(17,0)$.\nThe midpoint of the side connecting $(0,0)$ and $(16,24)$ is $(8,12)$.\nThe midpoint of the side connecting $(34,0)$ and $(16,24)$ is $(25,12)$.\nNow, let's fold the paper triangle along the sides of the midpoint triangle.\nThe vertex $(0,0)$ will fold to a point above the midpoint of the side connecting $(25,12)$ and $(17,0)$.\nThe vertex $(34,0)$ will fold to a point above the midpoint of the side connecting $(8,12)$ and $(17,0)$.\nThe vertex $(16,24)$ will fold to a point above the midpoint of the side connecting $(8,12)$ and $(25,12)$.\nSince all three vertices fold to points above the midpoint triangle, the apex of the pyramid is the centroid of the triangle formed by these three points.\nThe centroid of a triangle is the point where the medians intersect, and it is also the average of the coordinates of the vertices.\nThus, the coordinates of the apex are $(\\frac{0+34+16}{3}, \\frac{0+0+24}{3}) = (16, 8)$.\nNow we need to find the height of the pyramid.\nThe height will be perpendicular to the plane of the midpoint triangle and pass through the apex.\nWe can find the equation of the plane containing the midpoint triangle by finding the normal vector to the plane and using the coordinates of one of the vertices.\nThe normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors formed by the sides of the triangle.\nLet vector $\\textbf{a} = (25-8, 12-12, 0-0) = (17, 0, 0)$ and vector $\\textbf{b} = (17-8, 0-12, 0-0) = (9, -12, 0)$.\nThe cross product $\\textbf{a} \\times \\textbf{b} = (0, 0, -204)$, so the normal vector is $\\textbf{n} = (0, 0, -204)$.\nNow, using the coordinates of one of the vertices of the midpoint triangle, say $(17,0,0)$, the equation of the plane is $0(x-17) + 0(y-0) - 204(z-0) = 0$ or $z = 0$.\nSince the plane of the midpoint triangle is parallel to the xy-plane, the height of the pyramid is simply the z-coordinate of the apex, which is 8.\nNow we need to find the area of the base, which is the midpoint triangle.\nWe can use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the midpoint triangle.\nThe side connecting $(17,0)$ and $(8,12)$ has length $\\sqrt{(17-8)^2 + (0-12)^2} = 15$.\nThe side connecting $(17,0)$ and $(25,12)$ has length $\\sqrt{(25-17)^2 + (12-0)^2} = 13$.\nThe side connecting $(8,12)$ and $(25,12)$ has length $\\sqrt{(25-8)^2 + (12-12)^2} = 17$.\nUsing Heron's formula, we can find the area of the midpoint triangle.\nThe semiperimeter is $s = \\frac{15+13+17}{2} = 22.5$.\nThe area of the midpoint triangle is $\\sqrt{22.5(22.5-15)(22.5-13)(22.5-17)} = 90$.\nFinally, the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}(\\text{base area})(\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{3}(90)(8) = \\boxed{240}$.\nThe answer is 240.", "Let's think step by step\nThe vertices of the midpoint triangle are $(0,0), (25,12),$ and $(17,12).$\nThe altitude from vertex $(16,24)$ to the midpoint of the base is the height of the pyramid.\nWe can find this altitude by finding the distance from $(16,24)$ to the line that passes through $(0,0)$ and $(17,12).$\nThe equation of this line is $y=\\frac{12}{17}x.$\nWe use the point-to-line distance formula to find that the altitude has length $\\frac{24\\cdot17-16\\cdot12}{\\sqrt{12^2+17^2}}=\\frac{240}{25}.$\nThe area of the base triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(25)(12)=150,$ so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}(150)\\left(\\frac{240}{25}\\right)=\\boxed{288}.$\nThe answer is 288", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the midpoint triangle vertices. They are $(0,0), (17,12),$ and $(25,12)$. Now, let's find the lengths of the sides of the midpoint triangle: $17, 8,$ and $25$. Using Heron's formula, we find that the area of the midpoint triangle is $84$. \n\nNow, we need to find the height of the pyramid. To do this, we can look at the cross-section of the pyramid through the height and the midpoint of the base. This cross-section is a right triangle with legs of length $8$ and $17$. By the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse of this cross-section is $\\sqrt{8^2+17^2}=25$. Since the midpoint of the base is also the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the cross-section, we have a right triangle with legs of length $12$ (half the length of the hypotenuse) and $h$ (the height of the pyramid) and a hypotenuse of length $12.5$ (half the length of the side of the original triangle). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $h^2+12^2=12.5^2$, which gives us $h=2.5$.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.

The midpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(34,0)$ is $(17,0)$, the midpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(16,24)$ is $(8,12)$, and the midpoint of $(34,0)$ and $(16,24)$ is $(25,12)$.\n\nNow, consider the triangle formed by the midpoints. Its vertices are $(17,0)$, $(8,12)$, and $(25,12)$. The length of the base is the distance between $(17,0)$ and $(8,12)$ which can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(17-8)^2 + (0-12)^2} = \\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = 15$. The height of this triangle can be found by finding the perpendicular distance from $(25,12)$ to the line connecting $(17,0)$ and $(8,12)$.\n\nThe equation of the line connecting $(17,0)$ and $(8,12)$ is $y = \\frac{4}{3}(x-17)$. The slope of a line perpendicular to this line is $-\\frac{3}{4}$. The equation of the line passing through $(25,12)$ with this slope is $y - 12 = -\\frac{3}{4}(x - 25)$. \n\nTo find the intersection point of these two lines, we set their y-values equal to each other:\n\\[\\frac{4}{3}(x-17) = 12 - \\frac{3}{4}(x - 25)\\]\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 13$. Plugging this back into either equation, we find the intersection point is $(13,4)$. The distance between this intersection point and $(25,12)$ is the height of the triangle, which can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(25-13)^2 + (12-4)^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 8^2} = 20$.\n\nNow we have the base and the height of the triangle formed by the midpoints. The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 15 \\cdot 20 = 150$.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the pyramid. This is the distance from the vertex opposite the base to the plane containing the base. This vertex is $(16,24)$. We can find the equation of the plane containing the base by using the coordinates of the three points on the base and the general equation of a plane, $Ax + By + Cz = D$. \n\nThe three points on the base are $(17,0,0)$, $(8,12,0)$, and $(25,12,0)$. Plugging these points into the equation of the plane, we get the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    17A + 0B + 0C &= D \\\\\n    8A + 12B + 0C &= D \\\\\n    25A + 12B + 0C &= D\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second and third equations, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    -9A + 12B &= 0 \\\\\n    8A + 12B &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving this system, we find $A = \\frac{4}{3}$ and $B = -1$.

When the triangle is folded along the sides of the midpoint triangle, the vertices $(0,0)$, $(34,0)$, and $(16,24)$ will touch, forming the apex of the pyramid. We can find the height of the pyramid by finding the distance from the apex to the base of the pyramid, which is the midpoint triangle.\nWithout loss of generality, let $(0,0)$ be the apex of the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is the perpendicular distance from the point $(0,0)$ to the plane formed by the midpoint triangle.\nLet the equation of the plane be $ax+by+cz=d$. Since the points $(17,0,0)$, $(8,12,0)$, and $(25,12,0)$ lie on the plane, we can write three equations:\n1. $17a = d$\n2. $8a + 12b = d$\n3. $25a + 12c = d$\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equations 2 and 3, we get:\n1. $-9a + 12b = 0$\n2. $8a + 12c = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we find that $a = \\frac{4}{3}$ and $c = -\\frac{17}{3}$.
