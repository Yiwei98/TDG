Using the Shoelace Theorem or the determinant formula for the area of a triangle, the area of the left triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}|(0)(4)+(0)(k)+(2)(0)-(4)(0)-(2)(0)-(k)(0)|=\\frac{1}{2}(0)=0$. Doubling this gives the area of the pentagon as $2(0)=0$. Since we want the area to be 40 square units, we need to find the value of $k$ such that $0=40$. However, this is not possible, as there is no value of $k$ that will make the area of the pentagon equal to 40 square units.", "Let's think step by step\nThe pentagon ABCDE can be divided into a rectangle and two congruent triangles.\nThe rectangle has vertices at A, B, D, and E, and has an area of $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ square units.\nThe area of the two triangles is $40 - 16 = 24$ square units, so the area of one triangle is $24/2 = 12$ square units.\nLet the coordinates of vertex C be $(2, y)$.\nThe area of triangle BCD can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates: $\\frac{1}{2} |(x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2))|$, where $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ are the coordinates of the vertices.\nPlugging in the coordinates of vertices B, C, and D, we get: $\\frac{1}{2} |(0(4 - y) + 2(y - 4) + 4(4 - 4))| = 12$.\nSimplifying, we get $|y - 4| = 12$.\nThere are two possible values for $y$: $y = 4 + 12 = 16$ and $y = 4 - 12 = -8$.\nSince C is above B and D, we choose the positive value, so the $y$-coordinate of vertex C is $\\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is 16", "Let's think step by step\nWe first note that the area of the pentagon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the rectangle.\nThe area of the rectangle is $4\\times 4=16$ square units.\nLet $y$ be the $y$-coordinate of vertex C.\nThe area of triangle BCD is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 4\\times y=\\frac{4y}{2}=2y$ square units.\nSince the pentagon has a vertical line of symmetry, the area of triangle ABE is equal to the area of triangle BCD.\nSo, the total area of the pentagon is $16+2y+2y=16+4y$ square units.\nWe set this equal to 40 and solve for $y$:\n\\[16+4y=40\\]\n\\[4y=24\\]\n\\[y=\\boxed{6}\\]\nThe answer is 6"], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry"}
