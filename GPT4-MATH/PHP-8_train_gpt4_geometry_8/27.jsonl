Then, since the inradius of a triangle is given by the formula $r = \\frac{A}{s}$, where $A$ is the area and $s$ is the semiperimeter, we have \\[r_{I_B} = \\frac{K}{s_K} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_{I_C} = \\frac{L}{s_L},\\]where $s_K$ and $s_L$ are the semiperimeters of triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$, respectively.\n\nBy the angle bisector theorem, we have \\[\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{5}{8}.\\]Thus, \\[BD = \\frac{5}{13} \\cdot 14 = \\frac{70}{13} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad DC = \\frac{8}{13} \\cdot 14 = \\frac{112}{13}.\\]Now, we can find the semiperimeters of triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$: \\[s_K = \\frac{AB + BD + AD}{2} = \\frac{10 + 70/13 + AD}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_L = \\frac{AC + CD + AD}{2} = \\frac{16 + 112/13 + AD}{2}.\\]We can now express the inradii of triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ in terms of $AD$: \\[r_{I_B} = \\frac{K}{s_K} = \\frac{24\\sqrt{10} - L}{\\frac{10 + 70/13 + AD}{2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_{I_C} = \\frac{L}{s_L} = \\frac{L}{\\frac{16 + 112/13 + AD}{2}}.\\]Now, let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the angle bisectors from $B$ and $C$ in triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$, respectively. Then, $BE = r_{I_B}$ and $CF = r_{I_C}$.\n\nBy the incenter-excenter lemma, $I_C$ is the excenter of triangle $ABE$ opposite $A$, so $AE = BE + CF = r_{I_B} + r_{I_C}$. Similarly, $AF = r_{I_B} + r_{I_C}$. Thus, $AE = AF$, so $E$ and $F$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AA}$. Let this line intersect $\\overline{BC}$ at $G$. Then, $E$ and $F$ lie on the circle with diameter $\\overline{AG}$, so $\\angle BEF = 90^\\circ$. Since $P$ lies on both circles with diameters $\\overline{BE}$ and $\\overline{CF}$, we have $\\angle BPF = 90^\\circ$.\n\nLet $BP = x$ and $CP = y$. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem on triangles $BPD$ and $CPD$, we have \\[BD^2 - x^2 = PD^2 = CD^2 - y^2.\\]Substituting the values for $BD$ and $CD$, we get \\[\\frac{4900}{169} - x^2 = \\frac{12544}{169} - y^2.\\]Now, let $H$ be the orthocenter of triangle $BPC$. Then, $AH \\perp BC$, so $AH$ is the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$ in triangle $ABC$. Let $h$ be the length of this altitude. Then, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot 14 = 24\\sqrt{10}.\\]Thus, $h = 48\\sqrt{10}/7$.\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of triangle $BPC$, which is given by \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (48\\sqrt{10}/7) \\cdot PD.\\]Since $PD$ is fixed, we want to maximize the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$ in triangle $ABC$. This occurs when $A$ lies on the circle with diameter $\\overline{BC}$, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC \\cos \\angle BAC$, so \\[\\cos \\angle BAC = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC} = \\frac{1}{4}.\\]Then, the area of triangle $BPC$ is \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (48\\sqrt{10}/7) \\cdot PD = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot PD = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 48\\sqrt{10}/7 \\cdot \\frac{12544}{169} = 384\\sqrt{10} - 280\\sqrt{2}.\\]Thus, the answer is $384 + 280 + 10 = \\boxed{674}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}

Dividing these two equations, we get $\\frac{\\cos\\alpha - \\cos\\beta}{\\cos\\alpha - \\cos(\\alpha+\\beta)} = \\frac{5}{12}$. Now, using the sum-to-product and difference-to-product formulas for cosine, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nSince $\\alpha+\\beta < \\pi$, we have $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\right) > 0$. Thus, we can cancel the terms and obtain $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{12}$. Now, using the Pythagorean identity, we have $\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{119}{144}$, so $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{119}}{12}$, since $\\alpha > \\beta$.\n\nNow, we use the angle addition formula for cosine to get $\\cos\\alpha = \\cos(\\alpha-\\beta + \\beta) = \\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)\\cos\\beta + \\sin(\\alpha-\\beta)\\sin\\beta$. Plugging in our values, we have $\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{119}}{12}\\cos\\beta + \\frac{5}{12}\\sin\\beta$. Since $\\cos\\alpha$ is rational, we must have $\\cos\\beta = \\frac{a\\sqrt{119} + b}{c}$ and $\\sin\\beta = \\frac{d\\sqrt{119} + e}{f}$ for some integers $a, b, c, d, e, f$.\n\nHowever, $\\sin^2\\beta + \\cos^2\\beta = 1$, so substituting our expressions for $\\sin\\beta$ and $\\cos\\beta$, we get $\\frac{(ad + be)^2 + (af + de\\sqrt{119})^2 + (cf - bd)^2}{c^2f^2} = 1$. Since the denominator is a perfect square, the numerator must also be a perfect square. But the only way for the sum of two squares and a non-square to be a perfect square is if the two squares are equal and their sum is equal to the non-square. Thus, we must have $(ad + be)^2 = (af + de\\sqrt{119})^2 = (cf - bd)^2$.\n\nSince the first and second terms are equal, we have $ad + be = af + de\\sqrt{119}$, so $(a - f)d = be - de\\sqrt{119}$. Since $a - f$ and $d$ are integers, we must have $b = de$ and $a - f = d$. Now, since the first and third terms are equal, we have $ad + be = cf - bd$, so $(a + b)d = cf$. Since $a + b$ and $d$ are integers, we must have $c = (a + b)d$.\n\nNow, we have the system of equations:\n\n$a - f = d$,\n$b = de$,\n$c = (a + b)d$.\n\nSince none of $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are zero, we must have $d = 1$ (otherwise, $c$ would be divisible by $d^2$, but $c$ is not a perfect square). Thus, $a = f + 1$, $b = e$, and $c = (f + 1 + e)$. Substituting back into our expressions for $\\cos\\beta$ and $\\sin\\beta$, we have $\\cos\\beta = \\frac{(f + 1)\\sqrt{119} + e}{(f + 1 + e)}$ and $\\sin\\beta = \\frac{e\\sqrt{119} + f}{(f + 1 + e)}$.\n\nNow, substituting these expressions back into our equation for $\\cos\\alpha$, we get $\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{119}}{12}\\left(\\frac{(f + 1)\\sqrt{119} + e}{(f + 1 + e)}\\right) + \\frac{5}{12}\\left(\\frac{e\\sqrt{119} + f}{(f + 1 + e)}\\right) = \\frac{7\\sqrt{119} + 6}{12}$.\n\nThus, the sum of the numerator and denominator of $\\cos\\alpha$ is $7\\sqrt{119} + 6 + 12 = \\boxed{7\\sqrt{119} + 18}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the radius of the circle be $r$.
