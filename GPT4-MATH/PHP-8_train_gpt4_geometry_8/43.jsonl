Then, the legs of the isosceles right triangle are $s$ and $s+21$.\nWe have $s(s+21)=441$, so $s^2+21s-441=0$.\nWe could solve this quadratic, but first let's consider the other inscribed square.\nLet the side of the square in Figure 2 be $t$. Then, the legs of the isosceles right triangle are $t+t\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe have $(t+t\\sqrt{2})^2=t^2+2t^2\\sqrt{2}+2t^2=2t^2(1+\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince the sum of the areas of the two squares equals the area of the triangle, we have $t^2=2t^2(1+\\sqrt{2})-441$.\nDividing both sides by $t^2$, we get $1=2(1+\\sqrt{2})-\\frac{441}{t^2}$.\nThus, $\\frac{441}{t^2}=2(1+\\sqrt{2})-1=1+2\\sqrt{2}$.\nNow, we could solve this equation for $t^2$, or we could notice that the sum of the solutions to $s^2+21s-441=0$ is $-21$, so the other solution for $s$ is $-21-s$.\nThus, the other leg of the triangle is $(-21-s)+21=-s$, so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}s(-s)=\\frac{1}{2}s^2$.\nSince we want the area of the other square, we want the area of the triangle minus the area of the first square, which is $\\frac{1}{2}s^2-441=\\frac{1}{2}(441-441)=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is \\boxed{0}.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the side length of the square in Figure 1 be $s$.\nThen, let $x$ be the length of the segment $AC$ not covered by the square.\nWe have $x+s=AC$ and $x+s+s\\sqrt{2}=AB$.\nFrom the area of the square, we have $s=21$.\nSubstituting, we have $x+21=AC$ and $x+21+21\\sqrt{2}=AB$.\nNow, let the side length of the square in Figure 2 be $t$.\nThen, let $y$ be the length of the segment $AC$ not covered by the square.\nWe have $y+t\\sqrt{2}=AC$ and $y+t=AB$.\nSubstituting our expressions for $AC$ and $AB$, we have $y+21\\sqrt{2}=x+21+21\\sqrt{2}$ and $y+t=x+21$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get $21\\sqrt{2}=t-x$.\nSubstituting $x=y+t-21$ into this equation, we get $21\\sqrt{2}=t-(y+t-21)$.\nSolving for $y$, we get $y=21(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\nSubstituting this back into $y+t\\sqrt{2}=x+21$, we get $21(\\sqrt{2}-1)+t\\sqrt{2}=t+21-21(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\nSolving for $t$, we get $t=21\\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, the area of the square in Figure 2 is $21^2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{882}$.\nThe answer is 882", "Let's think step by step\nLet the side length of the square in Figure 1 be $s$.\nThen, $s^2 = 441$, so $s = 21$.\nLet $x$ be the length of the leg of $\\triangle ABC$.\nThen, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $x^2 + x^2 = (x + 21)^2$.\nSolving for $x$, we find $x = 42$.
