Then $O_{AB}, O_{BC}, O_{CA}$ are, respectively, the circumcenters of $\\triangle PAB, PBC, PCA$. According to the problem statement, the circumcenters of the triangles cannot lie within the interior of the respective triangles, since they are not on the paper. It follows that $\\angle APB, \\angle BPC, \\angle CPA > 90^{\\circ}$; the locus of each of the respective conditions for $P$ is the region inside the (semi)circles with diameters $\\overline{AB}, \\overline{BC}, \\overline{CA}$.\nWe note that the circle with diameter $AC$ covers the entire triangle because it is the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$, so it suffices to take the intersection of the circles about $AB, BC$. We note that their intersection lies entirely within $\\triangle ABC$ (the chord connecting the endpoints of the region is in fact the altitude of $\\triangle ABC$ from $B$). Thus, the area of the locus of $P$ (shaded region below) is simply the sum of two segments of the circles. If we construct the midpoints of $M_1, M_2 = \\overline{AB}, \\overline{BC}$ and note that $\\triangle M_1BM_2 \\sim \\triangle ABC$, we see that thse segments respectively cut a $120^{\\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18$ and $60^{\\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18\\sqrt{3}$.\n[asy] pair project(pair X, pair Y, real r){return X+r*(Y-X);} path endptproject(pair X, pair Y, real a, real b){return project(X,Y,a)--project(X,Y,b);}  pathpen = linewidth(1); size(250); pen dots = linetype(\"2 3\") + linewidth(0.7), dashes = linetype(\"8 6\")+linewidth(0.7)+blue, bluedots = linetype(\"1 4\") + linewidth(0.7) + blue; pair B = (0,0), A=(36,0), C=(0,36*3^.5), P=D(MP(\"P\",(6,25), NE)), F = D(foot(B,A,C)); D(D(MP(\"A\",A)) -- D(MP(\"B\",B)) -- D(MP(\"C\",C,N)) -- cycle); fill(arc((A+B)/2,18,60,180) -- arc((B+C)/2,18*3^.5,-90,-30) -- cycle, rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8)); D(arc((A+B)/2,18,0,180),dots); D(arc((B+C)/2,18*3^.5,-90,90),dots); D(arc((A+C)/2,36,120,300),dots); D(B--F,dots); D(D((B+C)/2)--F--D((A+B)/2),dots); D(C--P--B,dashes);D(P--A,dashes);  pair Fa = bisectorpoint(P,A), Fb = bisectorpoint(P,B), Fc = bisectorpoint(P,C); path La = endptproject((A+P)/2,Fa,20,-30), Lb = endptproject((B+P)/2,Fb,12,-35); D(La,bluedots);D(Lb,bluedots);D(endptproject((C+P)/2,Fc,18,-15),bluedots);D(IP(La,Lb),blue);  [/asy]\tThe diagram shows $P$ outside of the grayed locus; notice that the creases [the dotted blue] intersect within the triangle, which is against the problem conditions.

We claim that $X$ is a fold point if and only if $X$ is inside the circle with diameter $AB$. Note that since $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$, it follows that $O_C = A$ and $O_B = C$, so the creases through $O_C$ and $O_B$ are $AC$ and $AB$, respectively. Thus, for a fold point $X$, the crease through $O_A$ must not intersect $AB$ or $AC$.\n\nNow, let $X$ be a point inside $\\triangle ABC$ such that $X$ is inside the circle with diameter $AB$. Then, $XA + XB < AB$, so by the Triangle Inequality, $X$ is not on the crease through $O_C$. Similarly, $X$ is not on the crease through $O_B$. Since the crease through $O_A$ is a line, it must be inside $\\triangle ABC$, so $X$ is a fold point.\n\nConversely, let $X$ be a fold point. Then, since $X$ is not on the crease through $O_C$, it follows that $XA + XB > AB$. Similarly, $XA + XC > AC$. Adding these inequalities gives $2XA + XB + XC > AB + AC = 108$, so $XA + XB > 54$. Thus, $X$ is inside the circle with diameter $AB$.\n\nLet $R$ be the area of the set of all fold points. Then, the area of the set of all points inside $\\triangle ABC$ but not inside the circle with diameter $AB$ is $[ABC] - R$. Note that $\\triangle ABC$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle, so $[ABC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 36 \\cdot 72 = 1296$. The circle with diameter $AB$ has radius $18$, so its area is $324\\pi$.

Then, since $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$, we have that $O$ is the midpoint of $AC$. Thus, $AO = OC = 36$. Also, $AB = 36$, so $BO = \\sqrt{72^2 - 36^2} = 36\\sqrt{3}$.\nNow, let $P$ be a fold point.

Let the circle with radius $OM$ intersect $BC$ at $X$, let the circle with radius $ON$ intersect $AB$ at $Y$, and let the circle with radius $OO$ intersect $AC$ at $Z$.
