The slope of $\\ell$ is $\\frac{16-7}{13-1} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac 34$, so the line has the point-slope form $y - 7 = \\frac 34 (x - 1)$.

Then the area of the flag is $x^2$.\nThe area of the red cross is $0.36x^2$.\nLet the side length of the blue square be $y$. Then the area of the blue square is $y^2$.\nThe area of the four red triangles is $0.36x^2 - y^2$.\nNotice that each of the red triangles has a leg on the side of the flag, and the length of that leg is $x-y$.\nThe area of one red triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(x-y)^2$.\nSince there are four red triangles, the total area of the red triangles is $2(x-y)^2$.\nWe now have the equation $2(x-y)^2 = 0.36x^2 - y^2$.\nDivide both sides by 2, and we get $(x-y)^2 = 0.18x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}y^2$.\nNow we want to find the ratio $\\frac{y^2}{x^2}$, which represents the percentage of the flag that is blue.\nDivide both sides by $x^2$, and we get $\\frac{(x-y)^2}{x^2} = 0.18 - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{y^2}{x^2}$.\nLet $k = \\frac{y}{x}$. Then $\\frac{(x-y)^2}{x^2} = (1-k)^2$ and $\\frac{y^2}{x^2} = k^2$.\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation, and we get $(1-k)^2 = 0.18 - \\frac{1}{2}k^2$.\nExpanding, we get $1 - 2k + k^2 = 0.18 - \\frac{1}{2}k^2$.\nAdd $\\frac{1}{2}k^2 - k$ to both sides, and we get $k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0$.\nThis is a perfect square trinomial, so $(k-1)^2 = 0$.\nThus, $k = 1$, which means $y = x$.\nThe percentage of the flag that is blue is $\\frac{y^2}{x^2} = 1^2 = \\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is 1"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}
