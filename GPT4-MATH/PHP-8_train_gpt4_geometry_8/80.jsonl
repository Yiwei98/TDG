Let this intersection point be $P$.\n\nNow, let $O_1=(14,92)$, $O_2=(17,76)$, and $O_3=(19,84)$. We can find the distance between the centers of the circles: $O_1O_2=17$, $O_1O_3=13$, and $O_2O_3=8$. Since the line passes through the intersection of the circles centered at $O_1$ and $O_3$, we can find the area of the sector formed by $O_1PO_3$.

Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the centers of the circles with radii $3$ and centers at $(14, 92)$, $(17, 76)$, and $(19, 84)$, respectively.\n\nThe line divides each of the circles into two parts. Let $x_A$ be the area of the part of the circle centered at $A$ that is above the line, and let $x_B$ and $x_C$ be defined similarly. Then, we have $9\\pi - x_A = x_B + x_C$. Since the line passes through the center of the circle at $B$, we have $x_B = \\frac{9\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $x_A = x_C + \\frac{9\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, consider the area of the sector of the circle centered at $A$ that is formed by the line and the two radii that are tangent to the line. Let the angle of this sector be $2\\theta$. Then, the area of this sector is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\theta)(9) = 9\\theta$. Since the area of the part of the circle above the line is $x_A$, the area of the triangle formed by the line and the two radii is $9\\theta - x_A$. Similarly, let the angle of the sector of the circle centered at $C$ formed by the line and the two radii that are tangent to the line be $2\\phi$. Then, the area of the triangle formed by the line and the two radii is $9\\phi - x_C$.\n\nBy the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC$, we have $AC^2 = 10^2 + 6^2 - 2(10)(6)\\cos(2\\theta + 2\\phi)$. Since the line is the angle bisector of $\\angle AOC$, we have $\\cos(2\\theta + 2\\phi) = \\frac{AC^2 - AO^2 - OC^2}{2(AO)(OC)}$. Substituting the given values, we get $\\cos(2\\theta + 2\\phi) = \\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, $\\cos^2(2\\theta + 2\\phi) = \\frac{1}{64}$.\n\nNow, consider the quadrilateral formed by the line and the two radii tangent to the line in the circles centered at $A$ and $C$. Let the vertices of this quadrilateral be $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$, where $P$ and $R$ are on circle $A$, and $Q$ and $S$ are on circle $C$. Then, by the Law of Cosines on triangles $APR$ and $CQS$, we have $PR^2 = 18 - 36\\cos(2\\theta)$ and $QS^2 = 18 - 36\\cos(2\\phi)$. Therefore, $PR^2 + QS^2 = 36 - 36(\\cos(2\\theta) + \\cos(2\\phi))$.\n\nSince the quadrilateral $PQRS$ is cyclic, we have $\\angle PRS = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR$. Therefore, $\\cos(\\angle PRS) = -\\cos(\\angle PQR)$. By the Law of Cosines on triangle $PRS$, we have $PS^2 = PR^2 + RS^2 - 2(PR)(RS)\\cos(\\angle PRS) = PR^2 + RS^2 + 2(PR)(RS)\\cos(\\angle PQR)$. Since $PS^2 = PR^2 + QS^2$, we have $RS^2 + 2(PR)(RS)\\cos(\\angle PQR) = QS^2$. Rearranging, we get $\\cos(\\angle PQR) = \\frac{QS^2 - RS^2}{2(PR)(RS)}$.\n\nNow, $\\cos^2(\\angle PQR) = \\frac{(QS^2 - RS^2)^2}{4(PR^2)(RS^2)} = \\frac{1}{64}$. Therefore, $(QS^2 - RS^2)^2 = 64(PR^2)(RS^2)$. Since $RS^2 = 36 - PR^2$, we have $(QS^2 - (36 - PR^2))^2 = 64(PR^2)(36 - PR^2)$. Substituting $QS^2 = 36 - 36(\\cos(2\\theta) + \\cos(2\\phi))$, we get $(36(\\cos(2\\theta) + \\cos(2\\phi)) - PR^2)^2 = 64(PR^2)(36 - PR^2)$.\n\nNow, let $x = PR^2$. Then, we have $(36(\\cos(2\\theta) + \\cos(2\\phi)) - x)^2 = 64x(36 - x)$. Expanding and rearranging, we get $x^3 - 72x^2 + 144x - 36^2(\\cos(2\\theta) + \\cos(2\\phi))^2 = 0$. Since $x = PR^2 \\ge 0$, the only possible value of $x$ is $36$. Therefore, $PR^2 = 36$, and $PR = 6$.\n\nNow, let $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$ to $PR$. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $APR$, we have $h^2 = 9^2 - 6^2 = 45$. Therefore, the area of triangle $APR$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(h) = 9\\theta - x_A$. Substituting $x_A = x_C + \\frac{9\\pi}{2}$, we get $h = \\frac{9\\theta - x_C - \\frac{9\\pi}{2}}{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, let $k$ be the length of the altitude from $C$ to $QS$. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $CQS$, we have $k^2 = 9^2 - 6^2 = 45$. Therefore, the area of triangle $CQS$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(k) = 9\\phi - x_C$. Substituting $x_C = x_A - \\frac{9\\pi}{2}$, we get $k = \\frac{9\\phi - x_A + \\frac{9\\pi}{2}}{3}$.\n\nNow, consider triangle $ABC$. Let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, and let $K$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. Then, $AH = h + k$ and $CK = k$. Since $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle AHC \\sim \\triangle CKC$, we have $\\frac{AH}{AC} = \\frac{HC}{BC}$ and $\\frac{CK}{AC} = \\frac{KC}{AB}$. Substituting the given values, we get $\\frac{h + k}{10} = \\frac{h}{6}$ and $\\frac{k}{10} = \\frac{k}{6}$. Solving these equations, we get $h = 3$ and $k = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the line is $\\frac{h + k}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$. The absolute value of the slope is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the centers of the circles be $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let the intersection points of the line with the circles be $P$, $Q$, and $R$.

This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \\ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \\ldots 222$). At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square. Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don\u2019t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time. We must also account for the first square. This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares.\nThe number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$.
