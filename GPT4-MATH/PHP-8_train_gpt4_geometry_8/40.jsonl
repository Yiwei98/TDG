Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem on right $\\bigtriangleup AOD$ to find $AD$. We have $AD^2 = OA^2 + OD^2 = 2OA^2 = 2(2+OD)^2 - 2$. Thus, $AD = \\sqrt{2(2+OD)^2 - 2}$.\n\nThe area of $\\bigtriangleup AOD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(OA)(OD) = \\frac{1}{2}(2+OD)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$. The area of the five congruent triangles that make up the rest of the octagon is $5\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(2+OD)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{2}(2+OD)^2 - \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nFinally, the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADG$ is the area of the octagon minus the area of the five congruent triangles, which is $8(1+\\sqrt{2}) - \\left(\\frac{5}{2}(2+OD)^2 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right) = 8(1+\\sqrt{2}) - \\frac{5}{2}(2+OD)^2 + \\frac{5}{2}$. Since $AD = \\sqrt{2(2+OD)^2 - 2}$, we have $(2+OD)^2 = \\frac{AD^2+2}{2}$, so the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADG$ is $8(1+\\sqrt{2}) - \\frac{5}{2}\\cdot\\frac{AD^2+2}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\boxed{8 + 8\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{5}{4}AD^2}$.\nThe answer is 8 + 8\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{5}{4}AD^2", "Let's think step by step\nLet $O$ be the center of the regular octagon.\nThen $OA=OB=OC=OD=OE=OF=OG=OH=r$, the circumradius of the octagon.\nNote that $\\angle AOB = \\angle BOC = \\angle COD = \\angle DOE = \\angle EOF = \\angle FOG = \\angle GOH = \\angle HOA = 45^\\circ$.\nThus, $\\triangle AOB, \\triangle BOC, \\triangle COD, \\dots, \\triangle HOA$ are all congruent isosceles triangles.\nNow, consider $\\triangle AOB$.\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.\nThen $\\triangle AOM$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle with hypotenuse $AO$.\nSo, $AM = MO = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}r$.\nSince $AM=1$ (half of the side length of the octagon), we have $r = \\sqrt{2}$.\nNow we want to find the area of $\\triangle ADG$.\nNote that $\\angle ADG = \\angle AOG = 3 \\cdot 45^\\circ = 135^\\circ$.\nBy the Law of Cosines, we have\n\\[AD^2 = AO^2 + OG^2 - 2(AO)(OG)\\cos 135^\\circ = 2 + 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}.\\]\nNow, by Heron's formula, the area of $\\triangle ADG$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{s(s-AD)(s-AO)(s-OG)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{AD+AO+OG}{2}\\left(\\frac{AD-AO+OG}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-AD+AO+OG}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{AD+AO-OG}{2}\\right)}\\]\n\\[= \\sqrt{\\frac{AD^2}{4} - \\frac{(AO^2 - OG^2)^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{AD^2 - (AO^2 - OG^2)^2}{4}}\\]\n\\[= \\sqrt{\\frac{6 + 4\\sqrt{2} - (0)^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} + \\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} + 1}.\\]\nThe answer is \\sqrt{2} + 1", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, let's draw a diagram of the regular octagon and the triangle ADG.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\n\nA = dir(0);\nB = dir(45);\nC = dir(2*45);\nD = dir(3*45);\nE = dir(4*45);\nF = dir(5*45);\nG = dir(6*45);\nH = dir(7*45);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--G--H--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--G--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, E);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, S);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, S);\nlabel(\"$H$\", H, E);\n[/asy]\n\nWe can divide the regular octagon into eight congruent isosceles triangles by drawing segments from the center of the octagon to each vertex.

We can now divide each of these isosceles triangles into two right triangles by drawing an altitude from the center of the octagon to the midpoint of the base. Each of these right triangles has a hypotenuse of length $r$ (the distance from the center of the octagon to a vertex) and angles of $22.5^\\circ$, $67.5^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$. \n\nNow we can use right triangle trigonometry to find $r$.

This, the height-to-base ratio of each of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is equal to $6/12 = 1/2$.
