So, the diameter of the sphere is 2 meters, and the radius is 1 meter.\n\nNow, we inscribe a cube within the sphere. The space diagonal of the inner cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 2 meters. Let $a$ be the side length of the inner cube. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, we have $a^2 + a^2 + a^2 = 2^2$, or $3a^2 = 4$.
