{"question": "The diagonals of a regular hexagon have two possible lengths. What is the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.", "answer": "The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$.  The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees. Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees.  Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees. This implies that $\\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.

Since $\\triangle AEC$ is a right triangle with $\\angle AEC = 90^\\circ - 7.5^\\circ = 82.5^\\circ$, we can use the Law of Sines to find $EC$:\n\n\\[\\frac{EC}{\\sin 82.5^\\circ} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin 7.5^\\circ}\\]\n\nSolving for $EC$, we get:\n\n\\[EC = AC \\cdot \\frac{\\sin 82.5^\\circ}{\\sin 7.5^\\circ} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin 82.5^\\circ}{\\sin 7.5^\\circ}\\]\n\nUsing the half-angle identities for sine, we can simplify this expression:\n\n\\[\\sin 82.5^\\circ = \\sin (45^\\circ + 37.5^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}+\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}})}{4}\\]\n\n\\[\\sin 7.5^\\circ = \\sin (45^\\circ - 37.5^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}})}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[EC = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}+\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}})}{4}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}})}{4}} = 6(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{2}) = 6\\sqrt{2} + 6\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo the expression for $EC$ is in the form $a(\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{c})$ with $a=6$, $b=2$, and $c=2$. Thus, $a+b+c = 6+2+2 = \\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find that $\\angle ECB=30^\\circ$ and $\\angle DBC=90^\\circ$.\nNow, let $F$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$.\nThen $AF=12\\cos{30^\\circ}=6\\sqrt{3}$, $BF=12\\sin{30^\\circ}=6$, and $AB=2AF=12\\sqrt{3}$.\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AFB$, we find that $FB=6\\sqrt{7}$.\nNow, let $x=EC$.\nThen $BC=12=BE+6\\sqrt{7}+x\\cos{30^\\circ}$, so $x\\cos{30^\\circ}=6-6\\sqrt{7}$.\nAlso, $x\\sin{30^\\circ}=DE=12\\sqrt{3}-6\\sqrt{3}=6\\sqrt{3}$.\nDividing these two equations, we find that $\\tan{30^\\circ}=\\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{6-6\\sqrt{7}}$.\nSolving for $x$, we find that $x=6(\\sqrt{7}+\\sqrt{3})$.\nThus, the answer is $6+7+3=\\boxed{16}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $x = m\\angle ECB$.
