We can form a right triangle with the height of the segment, the radius, and half of the chord as the sides. The length of half of the chord is $\\sqrt{2^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. So, the length of the chord is $2$ feet. Now we can find the central angle. We have $\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) = \\frac{3}{2}$, so $\\theta = 2 \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nThe area of the sector is $\\frac{1}{2} \\theta \\cdot 2^2 = 2\\theta$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 3$. Therefore, the area of the segment is $2\\theta - 3$. The volume of the oil is the area of the segment multiplied by the length of the tank, which is $15$ feet. So, the volume of the oil is $15(2\\theta - 3)$.\n\nNow we want to find the depth of the oil when the tank is standing upright. Let $h$ be the depth of the oil. The volume of the oil will be the same, so we have $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2^2) h = 15(2\\theta - 3)$. Solving for $h$, we get $h = \\frac{15(2\\theta - 3)}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi} \\approx 3.6$ feet.\n\nSo, the depth of the oil when the tank is standing upright is approximately $\\boxed{3.6}$ feet to the nearest tenth.", "Let's think step by step\nWhen the tank is lying flat on its side, the oil forms a segment of a circle with radius 2 feet and height 1 foot (since the oil is 3 feet deep, and the diameter is 4 feet).\nThe area of this segment can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord from the area of the sector formed by the radii and the arc.\nThe triangle is isosceles with side lengths 2, 2, and 2, so its area is $(1/2)(2)(1)=1$ square foot.\nThe sector has a central angle of 120 degrees (since the height of the triangle is half the base, and the triangle is isosceles), so its area is $(1/3)(4\\pi)=4\\pi/3$ square feet.\nThus, the area of the segment is $4\\pi/3-1$ square feet.\n\nNow, consider the tank standing upright on one of its bases.\nThe volume of the oil inside the tank is equal to the area of the segment multiplied by the height of the tank, or $(4\\pi/3-1)(15)=20\\pi-15$ cubic feet.\nThe volume of the oil can also be expressed as the area of the circular base multiplied by the depth of the oil: $(2^2\\pi)(d)=4\\pi d$ cubic feet, where $d$ is the depth of the oil.\nSetting these two expressions for the volume equal, we get $20\\pi-15=4\\pi d$.\nSolving for $d$, we find $d=\\frac{20\\pi-15}{4\\pi}=\\frac{5}{\\pi}\\approx\\boxed{1.6}$ feet.\nThe answer is 1.6", "Let's think step by step\nWhen the tank is lying flat on its side, the cross-section is a circle of diameter $4$ feet, and the oil forms a segment of height $3$ feet.\nLet the center of the circle be $O$, and let $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints of the chord that forms the top of the oil.\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, and let $D$ be the point on $\\overline{OA}$ such that $\\overline{MD} \\perp \\overline{OA}$.\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, D, M, O;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = dir(180 - aCos(3/4));\nB = dir(aCos(3/4));\nD = (0,3/4);\nM = (A + B)/2;\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(O--A);\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--D);\ndraw(M--D);\n\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, S);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, W);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, E);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, N);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nThen $\\triangle OMD \\sim \\triangle OAB$, so \\[\\frac{OM}{OA} = \\frac{MD}{AB}.\\]Since $OA = 2$ feet, $OM = 2 - 3 = -1$ foot, $MD = \\frac{3}{4}$ foot, and $AB = 2 \\sqrt{7}$ feet, so \\[\\frac{-1}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{2 \\sqrt{7}}.\\]Then $2 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{3}{2}$, so the area of the segment is \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\sqrt{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{7}}{2}\\] square feet.\n\nWhen the tank is standing upright on one of its bases, the cross-section is a rectangle of width $4$ feet and height $x$ feet, so the area of the cross-section is $4x$ square feet.

The volume of oil is then the area of this circle (with radius 1.5 feet) multiplied by the length (or height) of the cylinder, which is 15 feet.

This altitude divides the 30-60-90 triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg of each of these smaller triangles is $r$, and the shorter leg is the distance from the center of the sphere to the base of the cone, which is $18 - r$.
