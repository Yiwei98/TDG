Let $T$ be the origin, and let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be on the positive $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. Then $A=(12,0,0)$, $B=(0,12,0)$, and $C=(0,0,6)$. The plane determined by $A$, $B$, and $C$ has equation $ax+by+cz=d$. Plugging in the coordinates of $A$, $B$, and $C$, we get three equations: $12a=d$, $12b=d$, and $6c=d$. Since $TA=TB$, we have $a=b$. Also, $TC=6$, so $c=\\frac{1}{2}a$. Thus, the equation of plane $ABC$ is $ax+ay+\\frac{1}{2}az=d$. We want the distance from the origin to this plane, which is given by the formula $\\frac{|d|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$. Plugging in our values, we get $\\frac{12a}{\\sqrt{a^2+a^2+\\frac{1}{4}a^2}}=\\frac{12a}{\\frac{5}{4}a}=\\boxed{9.6}$.\nThe answer is 9.6", "Let's think step by step\nSince $\\overline{TA}$, $\\overline{TB}$, and $\\overline{TC}$ are all perpendicular to each other, the triangle $TABC$ is a right triangular pyramid.
