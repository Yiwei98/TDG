Now, we know that the product of the radii is 68, so we have $ab = 68$. Substituting, we have $81a^4 - 972a^3(68/a) + 324a^2(68/a)^2 + 2916a^3 - 5832a^2(68/a) + 1944a(68/a)^2 + 6561a^2 - 13122a(68/a) + 6561(68/a)^2 - 4374a + 6561 = 0$. Canceling terms and simplifying, we have $81a^4 - 66096a^2 + 1497696 = 0$. Factoring, we have $(a^2 - 816)(81a^2 - 1848) = 0$. Thus, $a^2 = 816$, so $b^2 = 408$.

Then $\\angle QO_1 P = \\arctan m$, so $\\angle O_1 PQ = \\arctan \\frac{1}{m}$, and $\\angle O_1 (9,6) Q = 90^{\\circ} - \\angle O_1 PQ = \\arctan m$. Thus, $\\frac{O_1 Q}{O_1 (9,6)} = \\tan \\angle O_1 (9,6) Q = m$. But $O_1 Q = O_1 P - PQ = d_1 - 6$, and $O_1 (9,6) = \\sqrt{d_1^2 - 9^2}$, so $\\frac{d_1 - 6}{\\sqrt{d_1^2 - 9^2}} = m$. Similarly, $\\frac{d_2 + 6}{\\sqrt{d_2^2 - 9^2}} = m$. Eliminating $m$, we get $\\frac{d_1 - 6}{\\sqrt{d_1^2 - 9^2}} = \\frac{d_2 + 6}{\\sqrt{d_2^2 - 9^2}}$. Squaring and cross-multiplying, $(d_1 - 6)^2 (d_2^2 - 9^2) = (d_2 + 6)^2 (d_1^2 - 9^2)$. Expanding and canceling $81 d_1 d_2$, we get $-12 d_1^2 - 12 d_2^2 = -144 d_1 - 144 d_2$. Thus, $d_1 + d_2 = 12$. Now, $68 = d_1 d_2 (1 + m^2) = 12 d_1 m^2$, so $m^2 = \\frac{17}{3 d_1}$. Substituting into the equation $\\frac{d_1 - 6}{\\sqrt{d_1^2 - 9^2}} = m$, we get $\\frac{d_1 - 6}{\\sqrt{d_1^2 - 9^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{3 d_1}}$. Squaring and cross-multiplying, we get $3 (d_1 - 6)^2 = 17 d_1 (d_1^2 - 9^2)$. Substituting $d_2 = 12 - d_1$, we get $3 (6 - d_1)^2 = 17 d_1 (9^2 - (12 - d_1)^2)$. Expanding and canceling $81 d_1$, we get $- 17 d_1^3 + 306 d_1^2 - 2916 d_1 = 0$. Factoring out $d_1$, we get $d_1 (17 d_1^2 - 289 d_1 + 2916) = 0$. The quadratic factors as $(d_1 - 12)(17 d_1 - 243) = 0$, so $d_1 = 12$ or $d_1 = \\frac{243}{17}$. But $d_1 < 12$, so $d_1 = \\frac{243}{17}$, and $m = \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{3 d_1}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{17}}{17}$. Thus, $a + b + c = 3 + 17 + 17 = \\boxed{037}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}
