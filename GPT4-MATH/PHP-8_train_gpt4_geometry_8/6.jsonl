Since $AB$ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, we have $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$, or $(x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2 = 60^2$.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $y_A-y_B = x_A-x_B+2$. Squaring both sides, we get $(y_A-y_B)^2 = (x_A-x_B)^2 + 4(x_A-x_B) + 4$. Substituting $(x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2 = 60^2$ and solving for $x_A-x_B$, we get $x_A-x_B = 56$.\n\nNow, substituting this back into the equation $y_A-y_B = x_A-x_B+2$, we get $y_A-y_B = 58$. Since $x_A-x_B = 56$ and $y_A-y_B = 58$, we have $x_A = x_B+56$ and $y_A = y_B+58$.\n\nNow, we can use the distance formula to find the length of $AC$ and $BC$. We have $AC = \\sqrt{(x_A-x_C)^2 + (y_A-y_C)^2}$ and $BC = \\sqrt{(x_B-x_C)^2 + (y_B-y_C)^2}$. Since $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$, we have $60^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the area of the triangle. The area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BC$. We know that $AC^2 + BC^2 = 60^2$, so $AC \\cdot BC = \\sqrt{60^4 - (AC^2 - BC^2)^2}$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $x_A$, $x_B$, $y_A$, and $y_B$, we get $AC^2 - BC^2 = 56^2 + 58^2 - 2(56)(58) = 4$. Therefore, $AC \\cdot BC = \\sqrt{60^4 - 4^2} = \\sqrt{60^2(60^2-4)} = 60\\sqrt{60^2-4}$.\n\nFinally, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 60\\sqrt{60^2-4} = \\boxed{1800\\sqrt{899}}$.\nThe answer is 1800\\sqrt{899}", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, recall that the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, which divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. Let $G$ be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. Let $M_A$ and $M_B$ be the midpoints of sides $BC$ and $AC$, respectively. Then, $M_A$ lies on the line $y = x + 3$, and $M_B$ lies on the line $y = 2x + 4$. Since $M_A$ is the midpoint of the side opposite vertex $A$, we have the coordinates of $A$ are $(x_A, x_A + 3)$. Similarly, $B$ has coordinates $(x_B, 2x_B + 4)$. \n\nNow, we use the fact that $G$ divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. Thus, the coordinates of $G$ can be expressed as $(\\frac{2x_A + x_B}{3}, \\frac{2(x_A + 3) + (2x_B + 4)}{3})$ and $(\\frac{x_A + 2x_B}{3}, \\frac{(x_A + 3) + 2(2x_B + 4)}{3})$. Since $G$ is the same point in both cases, we can equate the coordinates and obtain the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2x_A + x_B}{3} &= \\frac{x_A + 2x_B}{3} \\\\\n\\frac{2(x_A + 3) + (2x_B + 4)}{3} &= \\frac{(x_A + 3) + 2(2x_B + 4)}{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving this system, we find that $x_A = -\\frac{3}{5}$ and $x_B = \\frac{9}{5}$. Thus, the coordinates of $A$ are $(-\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{12}{5})$ and the coordinates of $B$ are $(\\frac{9}{5},\\frac{22}{5})$. \n\nNow, we can use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$. Let $C$ have coordinates $(x_C, y_C)$. Then, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nAC &= \\sqrt{(x_C + \\frac{3}{5})^2 + (y_C - \\frac{12}{5})^2} \\\\\nBC &= \\sqrt{(x_C - \\frac{9}{5})^2 + (y_C - \\frac{22}{5})^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $AB = 60$ and triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nAC^2 + BC^2 &= 60^2 \\\\\n(x_C + \\frac{3}{5})^2 + (y_C - \\frac{12}{5})^2 + (x_C - \\frac{9}{5})^2 + (y_C - \\frac{22}{5})^2 &= 3600\n\\end{align*}\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x_C^2 + 2y_C^2 - \\frac{48}{5}x_C - \\frac{68}{5}y_C + \\frac{101}{5} &= 3600\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we use the fact that $C$ lies on both lines $y = x + 3$ and $y = 2x + 4$. Substituting $y = x + 3$ and $y = 2x + 4$ into the equation above, we obtain two separate quadratic equations in $x_C$. Solving these equations, we find two possible sets of coordinates for $C$: $(15, 18)$ and $(24, 48)$. \n\nFor $C = (15, 18)$, we find that $AC = 45$ and $BC = 27$. For $C = (24, 48)$, we find that $AC = 40$ and $BC = 50$. In both cases, the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC)$. For the first case, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(45)(27) = 607.5$. For the second case, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(40)(50) = 1000$. The smallest possible area of triangle $ABC$ is thus $\\boxed{607.5}$.", "Let's think step by step\nSince the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, we know that the centroid of triangle $ABC$ lies on both the line $y=x+3$ and the line $y=2x+4$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the centroid has coordinates $(1,4)$. \n\nLet $A=(x_1,y_1)$, $B=(x_2,y_2)$, and $C=(x_3,y_3)$. Since the median from vertex $A$ has a slope of $1$, it follows that the midpoint of $BC$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x_2+x_3}{2},\\frac{y_2+y_3}{2}\\right)=(x_1-3,y_1-3)$. Similarly, since the median from vertex $B$ has a slope of $2$, it follows that the midpoint of $AC$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_3}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_3}{2}\\right)=(x_2-2,y_2-2)$. \n\nNow, we use the fact that the centroid divides the medians in a $2:1$ ratio.

Since triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with a right angle at $C$, we know that $C$ must be either $(7,2)$ or $(-1,10)$. However, if $C=(-1,10)$, then the hypotenuse $AB$ would have a length of $\\sqrt{(-1-7)^2+(10-2)^2}=10\\sqrt{2}$, which is not equal to $60$. Thus, we must have $C=(7,2)$. \n\nNow that we have the coordinates of all three vertices, we can find the area of triangle $ABC$. The side lengths are $AC=8$, $BC=52$, and $AB=60$. Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(8)(52)=\\boxed{208}$.\nThe answer is 208", "Let's think step by step\nSince the medians from $A$ and $B$ lie on the lines $y=x+3$ and $y=2x+4$, respectively, the midpoint of $BC$ lies on $y=x+3$ and the midpoint of $AC$ lies on $y=2x+4$. Let $D$ and $E$ be the midpoints of $BC$ and $AC$, respectively.\n\nSince $ABC$ is a right triangle, it follows that $AB$ is a diameter of the circumcircle of $ABC$. Thus, the circumcenter of $ABC$ is the midpoint of $AB$. Let this midpoint be $F$. Then, $FD$ and $FE$ are medians of triangles $FAB$ and $FBA$, respectively. Since the medians of a triangle are concurrent, it follows that $F$ lies on both $y=x+3$ and $y=2x+4$. Solving this system of equations gives $F=(1,4)$.\n\nLet $A=(x_1, y_1)$ and $B=(x_2, y_2)$. Then, the midpoint of $AB$ is $F=\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)=(1,4)$. Therefore, $(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)=(2,8)$. Since the length of the hypotenuse $AB$ is $60$, we have $(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2=3600$. Expanding, we get $x_1^2-2x_1x_2+x_2^2+y_1^2-2y_1y_2+y_2^2=3600$.\n\nWe also know that the distance between $A$ and the line $y=2x+4$ is equal to the distance between $B$ and the line $y=x+3$. Let $A'$ and $B'$ be the projections of $A$ and $B$ onto the lines $y=2x+4$ and $y=x+3$, respectively. Then, we have $\\frac{|y_1-2x_1-4|}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{|y_2-x_2-3|}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get $10(y_1-2x_1-4)^2=5(y_2-x_2-3)^2$.\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations with three variables $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)=(2,8)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1^2-2x_1x_2+x_2^2+y_1^2-2y_1y_2+y_2^2&=3600, \\\\\n10(y_1-2x_1-4)^2&=5(y_2-x_2-3)^2, \\\\\n(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)&=(2,8).\n\\end{align*}\nSolving this system, we find that $A=(6,2)$ and $B=(-4,6)$, or $A=(-4,6)$ and $B=(6,2)$.

Without loss of generality, let angle $A$ be a right angle. Then, $AB$ is the hypotenuse, and $BC$ is the altitude from $B$ to $AC$. Since $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, the slope of $BC$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of $DE$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of $y=x+3$. Therefore, the slope of $BC$ is $-1$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $AC$, the slope of $AC$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BD$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of $y=2x+4$. Therefore, the slope of $AC$ is $-1/2$.\n\nNow we know that $AC$ has a slope of $-1/2$ and passes through $A$, and $BC$ has a slope of $-1$ and passes through $B$. Let $A$ have coordinates $(a,a+3)$ and $B$ have coordinates $(b,2b+4)$.

Since $G$ lies on both medians, we can substitute these expressions into the equations of the medians. For the median through $A$, we have $g_y = g_x + 3$. For the median through $B$, we have $g_y = 2g_x + 4$.
