To do this, we can square the first equation to get $(P+Q+R)^2 = P^2 + Q^2 + R^2 + 2(PQ + PR + QR) = 92^2$. Now, we can subtract $2$ times the second equation to eliminate the $PQ$, $PR$, and $QR$ terms: $P^2 + Q^2 + R^2 = 92^2 - 2(91)$. \n\nNext, note that by similar triangles, we have $\\frac{AP}{PB'} = \\frac{AO}{OB'} = P$, $\\frac{BQ}{QC'} = \\frac{BO}{OC'} = Q$, and $\\frac{CR}{RA'} = \\frac{CO}{OA'} = R$.

Thus, we can let $P = 1 + a$, $Q = 1 + b$, and $R = 1 + c$ for some positive numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
