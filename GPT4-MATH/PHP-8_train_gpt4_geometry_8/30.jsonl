Thus, $u + v = 451 + 1 = \\boxed{452}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first find the coordinates of each point.\nPoint $A$ is given as $(u,v)$.\nPoint $B$ is the reflection of $A$ across the line $y=x$, so $B=(v,u)$.\nPoint $C$ is the reflection of $B$ across the y-axis, so $C=(-v,u)$.\nPoint $D$ is the reflection of $C$ across the x-axis, so $D=(-v,-u)$.\nPoint $E$ is the reflection of $D$ across the y-axis, so $E=(v,-u)$.\n\nNow, we find the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ by dividing it into triangles and rectangles.\nThe area of triangle $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(u-v)^2$.\nThe area of rectangle $BCDE$ is $(u+v)(-2v)=2(u+v)v$.\nThe area of triangle $ADE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(u+v)^2$.\n\nSo, the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(u-v)^2 + 2(u+v)v + \\frac{1}{2}(u+v)^2 = 451$.\nSimplifying, we get $(u^2 - 2uv + v^2) + 4uv + (u^2 + 2uv + v^2) = 451$.\nCombining terms, we have $2u^2 + 4uv + 2v^2 = 451$.\nDividing by 2, we get $u^2 + 2uv + v^2 = 225.5$.\nNow, we know that $u$ and $v$ are integers, so this equation must be an integer.\nThus, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.\nGoing back to the area of rectangle $BCDE$, we see that it should be $(u+v)(2v)$, not $(u+v)(-2v)$.\nSo, the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(u-v)^2 + (u+v)(2v) + \\frac{1}{2}(u+v)^2 = 451$.\nSimplifying, we get $(u^2 - 2uv + v^2) + 4uv(u+v) + (u^2 + 2uv + v^2) = 451$.\nCombining terms, we have $2u^2 + 4u^2v + 4uv^2 + 2v^2 = 451$.\nThis equation is difficult to solve directly, so we look for a clever substitution.\n\nLet $x = u + v$ and $y = u - v$. Then, $u = \\frac{x+y}{2}$ and $v = \\frac{x-y}{2}$.\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation, we get:\n$2\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{x-y}{2}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x-y}{2}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{x-y}{2}\\right)^2 = 451$.\n\nSimplifying, we have $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + 4x^2y^2 + 4xy^2 + 2y^2 = 451$.\nRearranging, we get $4x^2y^2 + 2x^2 + 6xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 - 451 = 0$.\nNow, let $z = xy$. Then, $x = \\frac{z}{y}$ and $y = \\frac{z}{x}$.\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation, we get:\n$4z^4 + 2z^2 + 6z^3 + 4z^2 - 451 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in $z$, which is difficult to solve directly.\nHowever, we can use trial and error to find an integer solution for $z$.\nWe find that $z = 9$ is a solution, so $xy = 9$.\nNow, we can substitute $z = 9$ back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$ to find possible values for $u$ and $v$.\nFor example, if $x = 9$ and $y = 1$, then $u = 5$ and $v = 4$.\nThus, $u + v = 5 + 4 = \\boxed{9}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Geometry"}
