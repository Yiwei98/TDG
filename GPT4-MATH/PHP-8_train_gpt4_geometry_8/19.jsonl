Let $D$ be the point on $AC$ where Leah's head touches the cable, and let $E$ be the point on $AB$ that is directly above Leah's head.\n\nWe have a similar triangle situation, with $\\triangle ABE \\sim \\triangle ADC$. We know that $AD = 2.5$, $DE = 1.5$, and $AC = 3$. We want to find the height of the pole, which is $AB$.\n\nSetting up the proportion, we have:\n\n$\\frac{AB}{BE} = \\frac{AD}{DC}$\n\nWe know $AD = 2.5$ and $DC = AC - AD = 3 - 2.5 = 0.5$. So our proportion becomes:\n\n$\\frac{AB}{1.5} = \\frac{2.5}{0.5}$\n\nNow we can solve for $AB$:\n\n$AB = 1.5 \\cdot \\frac{2.5}{0.5} = 1.5 \\cdot 5 = 7.5$\n\nSo the telephone pole is $\\boxed{7.5}$ meters tall.\nThe answer is 7.5", "Let's think step by step\nLet $A$ be the base of the pole, $B$ be the top of the pole, and $C$ be the point where the cable is attached to the ground. Let $D$ be the point on the cable directly above Leah's head, and $E$ be the point on the ground directly below $D$. We have $AE = 2.5$ meters, $DE = 1.5$ meters, and $AC = 3$ meters.\n\nWe can now use similar triangles to solve for the height of the pole. Triangles $ABE$ and $CDE$ are similar, so we have $\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{BE}{DE}$. We know that $BE = AE - AC = 2.5 - 3 = -0.5$ meters and $DE = 1.5$ meters, so $\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{-0.5}{1.5} = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nWe also have triangles $ABC$ and $AED$ being similar, so $\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{AC}{AE}$. We know that $AC = 3$ meters and $AE = 2.5$ meters, so $\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{3}{2.5} = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n\nNow, we can use these two ratios to solve for $AB$. Since $\\frac{AB}{CD} = -\\frac{1}{3}$, we have $AB = -\\frac{1}{3} CD$. And since $\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{6}{5}$, we have $AB = \\frac{6}{5} AD$. Equating these two expressions for $AB$, we get $-\\frac{1}{3} CD = \\frac{6}{5} AD$.\n\nNow we can find the relationship between $AD$ and $CD$. Multiplying both sides by $-15$, we get $5 CD = 18 AD$. Since $AD + CD = AC = 3$ meters, we can write $CD = 3 - AD$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $5(3 - AD) = 18 AD$. Solving for $AD$, we find $AD = \\frac{15}{23}$ meters.\n\nNow we can find the height of the pole, $AB$. We have $AB = \\frac{6}{5} AD = \\frac{6}{5} \\cdot \\frac{15}{23} = \\frac{18}{23}$ meters. So the height of the pole is $\\boxed{\\frac{18}{23}}$ meters.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $A$ be the base of the pole, $B$ be the top of the pole, $C$ be the point on the ground where the cable is attached, and $D$ be the point on the cable where Leah's head touches. Also, let $E$ be the point on the ground directly below $D$. Since Leah is 1.5 meters tall and she is 2.5 meters from the base of the pole, we have $AE = 2.5$ and $DE = 1.5$. \n\nWe can use similar triangles to find the height of the pole. Since $ADE$ and $ABC$ are similar, we have $\\frac{DE}{AE} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$. Plugging in the values we know, we get $\\frac{1.5}{2.5} = \\frac{BC}{3}$. Solving for $BC$, we find that $BC = \\frac{1.5 \\cdot 3}{2.5} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8$.\n\nNow, we know that the height of the pole is the sum of the height of Leah (1.5 meters) and the height $BC$.

Since $OP$ is parallel to the ground, we know that $\\triangle OPB \\sim \\triangle OAB$. Furthermore, we know that Leah is 1.5 meters tall and has walked 2.5 meters from the base of the pole, so $OB = 2.5$ meters and $PB = 1.5$ meters.\n\nNow, let $x$ be the height of the pole, so $OP = x$.
