{"question": "Let $P_{1}: y=x^{2}+\\frac{101}{100}$ and $P_{2}: x=y^{2}+\\frac{45}{4}$ be two parabolas in the Cartesian plane. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the common tangent line of $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ that has a rational slope. If $\\mathcal{L}$ is written in the form $ax+by=c$ for positive integers $a,b,c$ where $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$, find $a+b+c$.\n", "answer": "From the condition that $\\mathcal L$ is tangent to $P_1$ we have that the system of equations $ax + by = c$ and ${y = x^2 + \\frac{101}{100}}$ has exactly one solution, so $ax + b(x^2 + \\frac{101}{100}) = c$ has exactly one solution. A quadratic equation with only one solution must have discriminant equal to zero, so we must have $a^2 - 4\\cdot b \\cdot (\\frac{101}{100}b - c) = 0$ or equivalently $25a^2 -101b^2 + 100bc = 0$. Applying the same process to $P_2$, we have that $a(y^2 + \\frac{45}4) + by = c$ has a unique root so $b^2 - 4\\cdot a \\cdot (\\frac{45}4a - c) = 0$ or equivalently $b^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0$. We multiply the first of these equations through by $a$ and the second through by $25b$ and subtract in order to eliminate $c$ and get $25a^3 + 1125 a^2b - 101ab^2 - 25b^3 = 0$. We know that the slope of $\\mathcal L$, $-\\frac b a$, is a rational number, so we divide this equation through by $-a^3$ and let $\\frac b a = q$ to get $25q^3 +101q^2 - 1125q - 25 = 0$. Since we're searching for a rational root, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to search all possibilities and find that $q = 5$ is a solution. (The other two roots are the roots of the quadratic equation $25q^2 + 226q +5 = 0$, both of which are irrational.) Thus $b = 5a$. Now we go back to one of our first equations, say $b^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0$, to get $25a^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0 \\Longrightarrow c = 5a$. (We can reject the alternate possibility $a = 0$ because that would give $a = b = 0$ and our \"line\" would not exist.) Then $a : b : c = 1 : 5 : 5$ and since the greatest common divisor of the three numbers is 1, $a = 1, b = 5, c = 5$ and $a + b + c = \\boxed{11}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nLet the tangent have slope $m$ and touch $P_1$ at $(x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2$ at $(x_2, y_2)$. Then $y_1 = mx_1 + \\frac{101}{100}$ and $x_2 = my_2 + \\frac{45}{4}$.\nSince the line is tangent to $P_1$, we have $y_1 = x_1^2 + \\frac{101}{100}$, so $mx_1 + \\frac{101}{100} = x_1^2 + \\frac{101}{100}$. Solving for $x_1$, we get $x_1 = \\frac{1}{m}$.\nSimilarly, since the line is tangent to $P_2$, we have $x_2 = y_2^2 + \\frac{45}{4}$, so $my_2 + \\frac{45}{4} = y_2^2 + \\frac{45}{4}$. Solving for $y_2$, we get $y_2 = \\frac{1}{m}$.\nThus, we have $x_1 = y_2 = \\frac{1}{m}$. Substituting this into $y_1 = mx_1 + \\frac{101}{100}$ and $x_2 = my_2 + \\frac{45}{4}$, we get $y_1 = \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{101}{100}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{45}{4}$.\nSince the tangent line passes through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, we can use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent line as $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. Substituting the values of $x_1$ and $y_1$, we get $y - \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{101}{100} = m\\left(x - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)$.\nMultiplying both sides by $100m$, we get $100my - 100 - 101m = 100mx^2 - 100m^2$. Rearranging, we get $100mx^2 - 100my + 100m^2 - 100 + 101m = 0$. Since $m$ is rational, all the coefficients must be integers. So, we can multiply both sides by $100$ to get $10000mx^2 - 10000my + 1000000m^2 - 10000 + 1010000m = 0$.\nThus, the equation of the line is $10000mx - 10000my + 1000000m^2 - 10000 + 1010000m = 0$. Since $m$ is rational, we can write $m = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors other than 1. Substituting this into the equation of the line, we get $10000\\frac{p}{q}x - 10000\\frac{p}{q}y + 1000000\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^2 - 10000 + 1010000\\frac{p}{q} = 0$.\nMultiplying both sides by $q$, we get $10000px - 10000py + 1000000\\frac{p^2}{q} - 10000q + 1010000p = 0$. Since $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$, we know that $q$ must divide $1000000\\frac{p^2}{q} - 10000q + 1010000p$. Therefore, $q$ must divide $10000(100p - q)$. Since $q$ cannot have any factors in common with $p$, we must have $q = 100$.\nSo, we have $m = \\frac{p}{100}$, and the equation of the line is $10000\\frac{p}{100}x - 10000\\frac{p}{100}y + 1000000\\left(\\frac{p}{100}\\right)^2 - 10000 + 1010000\\frac{p}{100} = 0$. Simplifying, we get $100px - 100py + 10000p^2 - 10000 + 10100p = 0$.\nThe equation of the line is $100px - 100py + 10000p^2 - 10000 + 10100p = 0$, and the integers $a, b, c$ are $100p, -100p, 10000p^2 - 10000 + 10100p$. Since $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, we must have $p = 1$. Thus, the equation of the line is $100x - 100y + 10000 - 10000 + 10100 = 0$, or $100x - 100y = -100$.\nThe answer is $a + b + c = 100 - 100 + 100 = \\boxed{100}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe will use the fact that a tangent line to a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ at a point $(x_1, y_1)$ has the form $y = 2ax_1(x - x_1) + y_1$.\nLet the common tangent line be $y = mx + k$.\nThis implies that $y_1 = mx_1 + k$.\nWe now have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\ny_1 &= x_1^2 + \\frac{101}{100} \\\\\nx_1 &= y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4} \\\\\ny_1 &= mx_1 + k\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting $y_1 = mx_1 + k$ into the first equation, we get $mx_1 + k = x_1^2 + \\frac{101}{100}$.\nSubstituting $x_1 = y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}$ into the third equation, we get $y_1 = m(y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}) + k$.\nNow, we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nmx_1 + k &= x_1^2 + \\frac{101}{100} \\\\\ny_1 &= m(y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}) + k\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting $x_1 = y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}$ into the first equation, we get $m(y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}) + k = (y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4})^2 + \\frac{101}{100}$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $y_1^4 - (4m - 1)y_1^2 + 8mk - \\frac{101}{100} = 0$.\nSince we are given that $m$ is rational, and $y_1$ is a solution to this quadratic equation, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\nHence, $(4m - 1)^2 - 4(8mk - \\frac{101}{100}) = n^2$ for some integer $n$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $16m^2 - 8m + 1 - 32mk + \\frac{404}{25} = n^2$.\nMultiplying by 25 to clear the fraction, we get $400m^2 - 200m + 25 - 800mk + 404 = 25n^2$.\nRearranging, we have $400m^2 - 800mk - 200m + 404 = 25n^2 - 25$.\nFactoring, we get $(4m - 1)(100m - 404) = 25(n^2 - 1)$.\nSince $4m - 1$ and $100m - 404$ are both integers, and their product is divisible by 25, one of them must be divisible by 25.\nWe can easily check that $4m - 1$ is not divisible by 25 for any rational $m$.\nThus, $100m - 404$ must be divisible by 25.\nThis implies that $m = \\frac{404 + 25k}{100}$ for some integer $k$.\nSince $m$ is rational, $k$ must be an integer.\nWe can easily check that $k = 4$ is the only value of $k$ that makes $4m - 1$ an integer.\nThus, $m = \\frac{404 + 25(4)}{100} = \\frac{504}{100} = \\frac{63}{25}$.\nNow, we can find $x_1$ and $y_1$ by substituting this value of $m$ into the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\ny_1 &= \\frac{63}{25}(y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}) + k \\\\\nmx_1 + k &= x_1^2 + \\frac{101}{100}\n\\end{align*}\nSolving, we get $x_1 = \\frac{225}{16}$, $y_1 = \\frac{289}{80}$, and $k = \\frac{4225}{64}$.\nThus, the common tangent line has the form $y = \\frac{63}{25}x + \\frac{4225}{64}$.\nMultiplying by 1600 to clear the fractions, we get $64y = 1008x + 4225$.\nDividing by 8, we get $8y = 126x + 529$.\nThus, $a + b + c = 8 + 126 + 529 = \\boxed{663}$.\nThe answer is 663.", "Let's think step by step\nSince the slope of the tangent line is rational, let it be $\\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime integers.\nLet the point of tangency to $P_1$ be $(x_1, y_1)$ and to $P_2$ be $(x_2, y_2)$.

Therefore, the derivative of the parabolas at these points must also have a slope of $\\frac{p}{q}$. Differentiating both equations for $P_1$ and $P_2$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ respectively, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dy_1}{dx_1} &= 2x_1 \\\\\n\\frac{dx_2}{dy_2} &= 2y_2\n\\end{align*}\nSince the slopes are equal, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x_1 &= \\frac{p}{q} \\\\\n2y_2 &= \\frac{q}{p}\n\\end{align*}\nFrom these equations, we can see that $x_1 = \\frac{p}{2}$ and $y_2 = \\frac{q}{2}$.

Solving these equations, we get $p = 9$ and $q = 4$. Thus, the slope of the tangent line is $\\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent line. Using the point-slope form and the fact that the tangent line passes through the point of tangency $(x_1, y_1)$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\ny - \\left(\\frac{9^2}{4} + \\frac{101}{100}\\right) &= \\frac{9}{4}(x - \\frac{9}{2})\n\\end{align*}\nMultiplying through by $100$ to clear denominators, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n100y - 8201 &= 225(x - \\frac{9}{2})\n\\end{align*}\nMultiplying through by $2$ and rearranging, we get the desired form of the tangent line:\n\\begin{align*}\n450x - 200y = 16402\n\\end{align*}\nThus, the answer is $450 + 200 + 16402 = \\boxed{17052}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet the slope of the tangent line be $m$.\nThe tangent line to $P_1$ will be of the form $y = mx + x^2 + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{m}$.\nThe tangent line to $P_2$ will be of the form $x = my + y^2 + \\frac{45}{4} - \\frac{1}{m}$.\nSince these two lines are the same, we must have $y = mx + x^2 + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{m}$ and $x = my + y^2 + \\frac{45}{4} - \\frac{1}{m}$.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get $y = m(my + y^2 + \\frac{45}{4} - \\frac{1}{m}) + (my + y^2 + \\frac{45}{4} - \\frac{1}{m})^2 + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{m}$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $y = (1 + m^2) y^2 + (2m^2 - 1) y + (m^2 - 2m + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{m})$.\nNow, we must have $1 + m^2 = 0$, $2m^2 - 1 = 0$, and $m^2 - 2m + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{m} = 0$.\nSolving the first two equations simultaneously, we get $m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSubstituting this value of $m$ into the third equation, we get $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = 0$.\nSolving for $m$, we get $m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent line.\nThe tangent line to $P_1$ is given by $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} x + x^2 + \\frac{101}{100} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$, we get $y\\sqrt{2} = x + x^2\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{101\\sqrt{2}}{100} - 1$.\nRearranging, we get $x^2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} x - y\\sqrt{2} + 1 - \\frac{101\\sqrt{2}}{100} = 0$.\nMultiplying both sides by $100$, we get $100x^2\\sqrt{2} + 100\\sqrt{2} x - 100y\\sqrt{2} + 100 - 101\\sqrt{2} = 0$.\nNow, we can write the equation in the form $ax + by = c$.\nWe have $100\\sqrt{2} x - 100y\\sqrt{2} = -100x^2\\sqrt{2} - 100 + 101\\sqrt{2}$.\nDividing both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$, we get $100x - 100y = -100x^2 - 100\\sqrt{2} + 101$.\nFinally, we can write the equation as $100x - 100y + 100\\sqrt{2} = 100x^2 + 101$.\nThe coefficients are $a = 100$, $b = -100$, and $c = 100\\sqrt{2} + 101$.\nThus, the answer is $100 + (-100) + (100\\sqrt{2} + 101) = \\boxed{101\\sqrt{2} + 1}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can rewrite $P_1$ as $y - x^2 = \\frac{101}{100}$ and $P_2$ as $x - y^2 = \\frac{45}{4}$.

Without loss of generality, let $A = (0,0)$, $B = (13,0)$, and $C = (5,12)$. Then the coordinates of the midpoint $M$ of $BC$ are $(9,6)$. Since the median from $A$ to $M$ has the same length as the median from $A'$ to $M$, and since the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, which is also the center of rotation $G$, we have $G = \\left(\\frac{9}{2},3\\right)$. Now we can find the coordinates of $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ by rotating $A$, $B$, and $C$ by $180^\\circ$ about $G$. We have $A' = (9,6)$, $B' = (1,6)$, and $C' = (-3,0)$. \n\nNow we find the area of the union of the two triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$. Note that the two triangles share an area equal to the area of triangle $A'BC'$.

Since a $180^\\circ$ rotation about $G$ takes $A$ to $A'$, $B$ to $B'$, and $C$ to $C'$, it follows that $G$ is also the centroid of triangle $A'B'C'$. Therefore, the medians of triangle $A'B'C'$ also intersect at $G$ and divide each other in a $2:1$ ratio.\n\nSince the medians of triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ have the same lengths, it follows that triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ have the same area. That is, $[A'B'C'] = [ABC] = 84$.\n\nNow, we look for the area of the intersection of triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$. The intersection of these triangles is a hexagon. Since the medians of a triangle divide each other in a $2:1$ ratio, it follows that each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of triangle $ABC$ and has one-third the length of the corresponding side. Therefore, the hexagon is equilateral, with side length $s = 4$.\n\nTo find the area of the hexagon, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles with side length $4$. The area of each equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the hexagon is $6(4\\sqrt{3}) = 24\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, the area of the union of triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ is\n$$[ABC] + [A'B'C'] - 2[\\text{hexagon}] = 84 + 84 - 2(24\\sqrt{3}) = 168 - 48\\sqrt{3}.$$\nThe answer is 168-48\\sqrt{3}.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the area of $\\triangle ABC$.
