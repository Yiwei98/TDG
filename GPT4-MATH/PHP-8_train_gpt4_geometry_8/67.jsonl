Let $h = AO = OP$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $h^2 + 6^2 = 10^2$, so $h = 8$. Thus, the area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(8) = 48$.\n\nNow, let's find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$. The area is the sum of the areas of the three triangles, which is $3(48) = 144$. The height of trapezoid $ABCD$ is equal to the height of the triangles, which is 8.\n\nLet $h_1$ and $h_2$ be the heights of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$, respectively. Since $X$ and $Y$ are midpoints, we know that $h_1 + h_2 = 8$. We also know that the ratio of the areas of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$ is equal to the ratio of their heights, since they share the same bases. Let this ratio be $k = \\frac{h_1}{h_2}$. Then, we can write the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ as $A_1 = 144\\cdot \\frac{h_1}{h_1 + h_2} = 144\\cdot \\frac{h_1}{8} = 18h_1$.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion: $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{h_1}{h_2} = k$, where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the areas of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$, respectively. Since $A_1 + A_2 = 144$, we have $A_2 = 144 - A_1$. Substituting and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$k = \\frac{18h_1}{144 - 18h_1}$$\n\nBut we also have $k = \\frac{h_1}{h_2}$, and since $h_1 + h_2 = 8$, we can write $k = \\frac{h_1}{8 - h_1}$. Setting these two expressions for $k$ equal to each other and solving for $h_1$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{h_1}{8 - h_1} = \\frac{18h_1}{144 - 18h_1}$$\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get $h_1 = \\frac{72}{5}$, and $h_2 = \\frac{40}{5}$. Now, we can find the ratio of the areas:\n\n$$\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{72/5}{40/5} = \\frac{72}{40} = \\frac{9}{5}$$\n\nSo the ratio of the areas of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$ is $9:5$, and $p + q = \\boxed{14}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the height of each of the isosceles triangles.\nLet $AP=h$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $OP=\\sqrt{10^2-h^2}$.\nSince $O$ is the midpoint of $AD$, $AP=DP$, and $DO=12$.\nSo, $OP=\\sqrt{12^2-h^2}$.\nThen, we have $\\sqrt{10^2-h^2}+\\sqrt{12^2-h^2}=12$.\nNow, we square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square roots.\nWe get $10^2-h^2+2\\sqrt{(10^2-h^2)(12^2-h^2)}+12^2-h^2=12^2$.\nWe cancel out $12^2$ on both sides and simplify the equation to get:\n$2\\sqrt{(10^2-h^2)(12^2-h^2)}=2h^2$.\nDivide both sides by 2 and square both sides again to get rid of the square root:\n$(10^2-h^2)(12^2-h^2)=h^4$.\nNow, we have a quartic equation in terms of $h$.\nWe can simplify it to $h^4-484h^2+14400=0$.\nFactoring, we get $(h^2-324)(h^2-160)=0$.\nThus, $h^2=324$ or $h^2=160$.\nSince $h$ is a height and must be less than 10, we choose $h^2=160$.\nNow, we know that $h=\\sqrt{160}$ and $OP=\\sqrt{10^2-h^2}=6$.\nThe area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AD+BC)(h)=\\frac{1}{2}(24)(\\sqrt{160})=12\\sqrt{160}$.\nThe area of triangle $AOP$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AP)(OP)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{160})(6)=3\\sqrt{160}$.\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are midpoints, the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ minus twice the area of triangle $AOP$.\nSo, the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ is $12\\sqrt{160}-2(3\\sqrt{160})=6\\sqrt{160}$.\nThe area of trapezoid $XYCD$ is $12\\sqrt{160}-6\\sqrt{160}=6\\sqrt{160}$.\nThus, the ratio of the areas of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$ is $6\\sqrt{160}:6\\sqrt{160}$, which simplifies to $1:1$.\nFinally, $p+q=1+1=\\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is 2", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the height $OP$ of the isosceles triangles.\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$.\nThen $\\triangle AOM \\sim \\triangle ADO$ by AA Similarity (both are right triangles that share an angle at $A$).\nSince $AM = \\frac{1}{2}AD = 6$, the ratio of similitude is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and so $OM = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 = 6$.\nThen $OP = AO - OM = 10 - 6 = 4$.\n\nNow, let $h$ be the height of trapezoid $ABYX$.\nThen the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+XY)(h)$ and the area of trapezoid $XYCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(XY+CD)(h)$.\nThus, the ratio of their areas is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(AB+XY)(h)}{\\frac{1}{2}(XY+CD)(h)} = \\frac{AB+XY}{XY+CD}.\\]Since $AB=CD=12$, we have \\[\\frac{AB+XY}{XY+CD} = \\frac{12+XY}{XY+12}.\\]Since $\\triangle AOM \\cong \\triangle YOC$ by SAS Congruence ($AO = OC$, $OM = OY$, and $\\angle AOM = \\angle YOC$), we have $AM = YC = 6$.\nTherefore, $XY = AB - (AM + YC) = 12 - (6+6) = 0$.\nThus, the ratio of the areas is $\\frac{12}{12} = 1$, and the answer is $1+1=\\boxed{2}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the area of each of the isosceles triangles $DAO$, $AOB$, and $OBC$.\n\nSince triangle $DAO$ is isosceles with $DA = AO$, we can drop an altitude from $A$ to $DO$ to form two right triangles. Let this altitude intersect $DO$ at point $E$. Then, $DE = 6$ and $AE = 8$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $AO = 10$.\n\nThe area of triangle $DAO$ is then $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(8) = 48$. Since all three isosceles triangles are congruent, the area of each is also 48.\n\nNow, we find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$. Since the trapezoid is formed from the three congruent triangles, its area is $3(48) = 144$.\n\nNext, we find the area of trapezoid $ABYX$. This trapezoid is formed from triangle $AOB$ and half of triangles $DAO$ and $OBC$.

The area of trapezoid $XYCD$ is the difference between the areas of trapezoid $ABCD$ and trapezoid $ABYX$, which is $144 - 96 = 48$. So, the ratio of the areas is $96:48$, which simplifies to $2:1$.
