If $a$ is a multiple of $3$, it can be written as $a = 3m$ for some integer $m$. Then, $a - b = 3m - 6k = 3(m - 2k)$, which is a multiple of $3$. So, statement B is true.\n\nC. We cannot conclude that $a-b$ is a multiple of $6$ just because $a$ is a multiple of $3$ and $b$ is a multiple of $6$. For example, if $a = 3$ and $b = 6$, then $a - b = -3$, which is not a multiple of $6$. So, statement C is false.\n\nD. We cannot conclude that $a-b$ is a multiple of $2$ just because $a$ is a multiple of $3$ and $b$ is a multiple of $6$. For example, if $a = 3$ and $b = 6$, then $a - b = -3$, which is not a multiple of $2$. So, statement D is false.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are A and B, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A,B}}$.", "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. Since $b$ is a multiple of $6$, it can be written as $6k$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $b = 2 \\cdot 3k$ which means that $b$ is a multiple of $3$. So, statement A is true.\n\nB. Since $a$ is a multiple of $3$ and $b$ is a multiple of $3$, their difference $(a-b)$ is also a multiple of $3$. So, statement B is true.\n\nC. It's not necessarily true that $(a-b)$ is a multiple of $6$. For example, if $a=3$ and $b=6$, then $(a-b)=-3$, which is not a multiple of $6$. So, statement C is false.\n\nD. It's not necessarily true that $(a-b)$ is a multiple of $2$. For example, if $a=3$ and $b=6$, then $(a-b)=-3$, which is not a multiple of $2$. So, statement D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A,B."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra"}
