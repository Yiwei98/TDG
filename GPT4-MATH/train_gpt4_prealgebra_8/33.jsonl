Margaret's mean score is the sum of her scores divided by the number of scores, which is $\\frac{279}{3} = \\boxed{93}$.\nThe answer is 93", "Let's think step by step\nCyprian has three test scores with a mean of 90, so the sum of his scores is $3 \\times 90 = 270$. \nThe sum of all six scores is $85 + 87 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 98 = 549$. \nSince the three scores that are not Cyprian's belong to Margaret, the sum of Margaret's scores is $549 - 270 = 279$. \nMargaret has three test scores, so her mean score is $279 \\div 3 = \\boxed{93}$.\nThe answer is 93", "Let's think step by step\nCyprian's total score is $3 \\times 90 = 270$. We can find the total score of all six tests: $85 + 87 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 98 = 549$. Since three of these scores are Cyprian's, the other three must be Margaret's. The total of Margaret's scores is $549 - 270 = 279$. Therefore, Margaret's mean score is $279 / 3 = \\boxed{93}$. The answer is 93"], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra"}
