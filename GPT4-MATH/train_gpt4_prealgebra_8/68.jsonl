At the end, Henry is 24 feet east and 32 feet south of his original location. These are the two legs of a right triangle, so we can figure out the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean  Theorem. Actually, 24 is $3 \\times 8$ and 32 is $4 \\times 8$, so this is just a multiple of the 3-4-5 triangle.
