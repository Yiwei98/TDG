If the tens digit is 1, then we only need to worry about the units digit. There are 5 multiples of 2 in the range 100-150 (102, 104, 106, 108, 110) and 1 multiple of 5 (105). So, there are 6 visible factor numbers with a tens digit of 1.\n\nIf the tens digit is 2, then the number must be divisible by 2. This means the units digit must be even. The only visible factor numbers in this case will be those divisible by both 2 and the units digit. The only possibility is 120, which is divisible by 2 and 4. So, there is 1 visible factor number with a tens digit of 2.\n\nIf the tens digit is 3, then the number must be divisible by 3.

However, 111 is not divisible by its units digit, so there are 3 visible factor numbers with a tens digit of 3.\n\nIf the tens digit is 4, then the number must be divisible by 4. The only multiple of 4 in the range 100-150 is 104, which is also divisible by its units digit. So, there is 1 visible factor number with a tens digit of 4.\n\nIf the tens digit is 5, then the number must be divisible by 5. The only multiples of 5 in the range 100-150 are 105 and 150.
