Since $\\triangle BPC$ is a right triangle with legs of length 4 and $2\\sqrt{3}$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $PC$: $PC = \\sqrt{4^2 + (2\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 12} = \\sqrt{28}$.\n\nFinally, we find the measure of angle $BPC$. Since $\\triangle BPC$ is a right triangle with legs of length 4 and $2\\sqrt{3}$, and hypotenuse of length $\\sqrt{28}$, we can use the cosine formula to find the measure of angle $BPC$: $\\cos(BPC) = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{28}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{7}}$. Therefore, the measure of angle $BPC$ is $\\boxed{\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first find the coordinates of the points in the diagram.\nLet $A=(0,0)$, $B=(4,0)$, $C=(4,-4)$, and $D=(0,-4)$.\nSince $\\triangle ABE$ is equilateral, $E$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $E=(4,-2)$.\nNow, we find the equation of the line $BE$.\nThe slope of $BE$ is $\\frac{-2-0}{4-0}=-\\frac{1}{2}$ and the equation of the line is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+2$.\nThe equation of the line $AC$ is $y=-x$.\nNow, we find the intersection point of the lines $BE$ and $AC$.\nWe have $-\\frac{1}{2}x+2=-x \\Rightarrow x=2$ and $y=-2$.\nSo, $P=(2,-2)$.\nSince $PQ$ is perpendicular to $BC$, we have $PQ \\parallel AD$.\nThus, $\\angle BPC = \\angle BPA = \\angle BAE = 60^{\\circ}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{60^{\\circ}}$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, since $\\triangle ABE$ is equilateral, $\\angle ABE = 60^\\circ$.
