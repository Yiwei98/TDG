Therefore, the last digit of $P$ must be 4, which means the last digit of $x$ must be 4 as well. Now, we have $P = 40,305 + x = 40,000 + 300 + 5 + x$.\nSince the last digit of $x$ is 4, we can write $x = 10a + 4$ for some integer $a$. Then, $P = 40,000 + 300 + 5 + 10a + 4 = 40,000 + 300 + 9 + 10a$. The last two digits of $P$ must be 09, so the last digit of $a$ must be 0. Now, we have $P = 40,000 + 300 + 9 + 100b$ for some integer $b$.\nSince the last three digits of $P$ must be 309, we have $P = 40,000 + 1000c + 309$ for some integer $c$. Now, we can see that $c$ must be 0, since the first digit of $P$ is 4. Thus, $P = 40,309$.\nSo, the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is $x = 10a + 4 = 10(10b) + 4 = 1000c + 4 = 4$. The answer is $\\boxed{4}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet's call the number we want to add to 40,305 as $n$. Then, the sum of the two numbers will be a palindrome: $40305 + n$.\nNow, let's reverse the digits of 40,305: 50,340.\nWe know that the sum of 40,305 and the reversed number 50,340 is a palindrome: $40305 + 50340 = 90645$. This is because when we add the two numbers, the digits will \"carry over\" and create the same digits in the reversed order.\nHowever, 50,340 is not the least number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome. We need to find the difference between 50,340 and the actual least number $n$.\nNotice that 90645 is 11 more than a multiple of 100, so we can subtract 11 from 50,340 to find the least value of $n$: $50340 - 11 = 50329$.\nTherefore, the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is $\\boxed{50329}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $x$ be the least number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome.\nWe know that $x+40305$ is a palindrome, so let's write it as $abcba$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits.\nNow, we can write $x+40305$ as $10001a+1010b+100c$.\nSince $x+40305=40305+x$, we have $40305=10001a+1010b+100c-x$.\nRearranging, we get $x=10001a+1010b+100c-40305$.\nWe want to minimize $x$, so we start by minimizing $a$.\nIf $a=3$, we get $x<0$ which is not possible.\nIf $a=4$, we have $x=10001(4)+1010b+100c-40305$.\nNow, we minimize $b$. If $b=0$, we get $x<0$ which is not possible.\nIf $b=1$, we have $x=10001(4)+1010(1)+100c-40305$.\nFinally, we minimize $c$.

To form a palindrome, the thousands and tens digits must be equal, and the ten-thousands and units digits must also be equal. We can write the resulting number as $(4, 0, 3, 0, 5) + x$.\n\nSince the thousands and tens digits must be equal, we know that the tens digit of $x$ must be 3, so $x$ is in the form of $x = (0, 3, 0, a, b)$. Now, we need to find the smallest $a$ and $b$ such that the ten-thousands and units digits are equal.\n\nIf we add 0 to the ten-thousands digit, we get 4, which doesn't match the units digit of 5. If we add 1 to the ten-thousands digit, we get 5, which matches the units digit. Therefore, $a = 1$. Since we added 1 to the ten-thousands digit, we must also add 1 to the units digit, so $b = 1$.\n\nThus, the least number we can add is $x = (0, 3, 0, 1, 1) = \\boxed{3011}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $x$ be the least number such that $40305 + x$ is a palindrome.\nThen, $40305 + x = ABCDE$, where $A, B, C, D, E$ are digits and $A \\neq 0$.\nSince $40305 + x$ is a palindrome, we must have $A = E$ and $B = D$.\nNow, $40305 + x = ABA0A$.\nSince $A = 4$, we have $x = 10000 - 40305 = 59695$.\nHowever, this value of $x$ does not make $B = D$.\nSo, we must have $A = 5$.\nThen, $40305 + x = 5BA05$.\nSince $5BA05 - 40305 = 20000$, we have $x = 20000 - (5 - 4) * 10000 = 10000$.\nNow, $40305 + 10000 = 50305$, which is a palindrome.\nThus, the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is $\\boxed{10000}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $n$ be the least natural number such that $40305+n$ is a palindrome.\nThe thousands digit of $40305+n$ must equal the units digit, so $n$ must end in a $5$.\nThe hundreds digit of $40305+n$ must equal the tens digit, so $n$ must be in the form $n=5x5$ for some digit $x$.\nWe check the possibilities for $x$: \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nx & 40305+5x5 & \\text{Palindrome?} \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 40355 & \\text{No} \\\\\n1 & 41505 & \\text{No} \\\\\n2 & 42655 & \\text{No} \\\\\n3 & 43805 & \\text{No} \\\\\n4 & 44955 & \\text{Yes}\n\\end{array}\n\\] The least such $n$ is $\\boxed{495}$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Number Theory"}
