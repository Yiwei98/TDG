We want to find the smallest possible value of $n = 8a + 5$ such that $n$ has three digits.\nFirst, let's find the smallest possible value of $a$ such that $8a$ has three digits. Since $8 \\cdot 13 = 104$, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $13$. We can now try increasing values of $a$ and check if the equation $8a - 5b = 3$ has an integer solution for $b$.\nFor $a = 13$, we have $8a - 3 = 101$. This is not a multiple of $5$, so we move on to the next value of $a$.\nFor $a = 14$, we have $8a - 3 = 109$. This is also not a multiple of $5$, so we move on.\nFor $a = 15$, we have $8a - 3 = 117$.
