However, this includes both the ordered pairs $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$, so we need to divide by 2 to get the unique ordered pairs. This gives us $\\frac{400}{2} = 200$ ordered pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$.\nBut, we are asked to find the ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x<y$. Since $a = x-6^{19}$ and $b = y-6^{19}$, we have $x<y$ if and only if $a<b$.

Therefore, we have the equation $\\frac{2xy}{x+y} = 6^{20}$ or $2xy = (x+y)6^{20}$.\n\nRearranging and factoring, we get $6^{20} - 2xy = x(6^{20} - 2y)$. Since $x < y$, we have $6^{20} - 2y > 6^{20} - 2x$, so $x$ must be a factor of $6^{20}$. Let $x = 2^a3^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers with $a \\le 20$ and $b \\le 20$. Then, $6^{20} - 2y = 2^a3^b(6^{20} - 2^{a+1}3^b)$. Since $x < y$, we have $6^{20} - 2^{a+1}3^b > 6^{20} - 2^{a+2}3^b$, so $2^a3^b$ must be a factor of $6^{20} - 2^{a+2}3^b$.
