Substituting the expressions for $a$ and $c$, we have $d^{\\frac{2}{3}} - b^{\\frac{4}{5}} = 19$.\nWe want to find $d - b$. To do this, let's first find a common exponent for $a$ and $c$.

Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all positive integers, the exponents must also be integers. Thus, we can conclude that the denominator of the exponents must divide the exponent of 19.

Similarly, since $c^3 = d^2$, we have $c = d^{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nThe given condition $c - a = 19$ can be written as $d^{\\frac{2}{3}} - b^{\\frac{4}{5}} = 19$.\nNow, we know that $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers. So, $b^{\\frac{4}{5}}$ and $d^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ must also be integers.\nThe smallest value for which $b^{\\frac{4}{5}}$ is an integer is $b = 5^{\\frac{5}{4}}$, which gives $a = 5$.\nSimilarly, the smallest value for which $d^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ is an integer is $d = 3^{\\frac{3}{2}}$, which gives $c = 3$.\nHowever, these values do not satisfy the condition $c - a = 19$. So, we need to find the next possible values for $a$ and $c$.\nThe next possible value for $a$ is $a = 2\\cdot 5 = 10$, which gives $b = 2^{\\frac{5}{4}}\\cdot 5^{\\frac{5}{4}}$.\nThe next possible value for $c$ is $c = 2\\cdot 3 = 6$, which gives $d = 2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot 3^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nThese values satisfy the condition $c - a = 19$, so we have $d = 2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot 3^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ and $b = 2^{\\frac{5}{4}}\\cdot 5^{\\frac{5}{4}}$.\nThus, $d - b = 2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot 3^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 2^{\\frac{5}{4}}\\cdot 5^{\\frac{5}{4}} = \\boxed{2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot 3^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 2^{\\frac{5}{4}}\\cdot 5^{\\frac{5}{4}}}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
