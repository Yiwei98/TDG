By Fermat's Little Theorem, we have $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nNow, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we know that $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{120}$, which means that $p^2$ can only leave a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ upon division by $120$.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, note that $120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. Since $p > 5$, we know that $p$ must be odd, so $p^2$ is also odd. Therefore, the remainder upon division by $120$ must be odd as well. This means that $p^2$ must leave a remainder of the form $2^2 \\cdot 3^a \\cdot 5^b$ for some $a, b \\geq 0$. Now, let's consider the remainders upon division by $3$ and $5$.\n\nIf $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $p^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, and if $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $p^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.

Thus, $p^2$ always leaves a remainder of $1$ upon division by $5$, so $b = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible remainders that $p^2$ can leave upon division by $120$ are of the form $2^2 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 4$. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible remainder.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, note that $120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\nFor a prime $p > 5$, $p$ must be odd, so $p^2$ must be odd as well. This means that $p^2$ must be divisible by neither 2 nor 4. Also, since $p$ cannot be divisible by 3, $p^2$ cannot be divisible by 3. Finally, since $p$ cannot be divisible by 5, $p^2$ cannot be divisible by 25.\n\nNow, consider the possible remainders of $p^2$ upon division by 120. Since $p^2$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, the possible remainders are 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 89, 91, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, and 119.

This leaves us with the remainders 1 and 7.\n\nWe can check that both of these remainders are attainable: for example, $7^2 = 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{120}$, and $11^2 = 121 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{120}$.
