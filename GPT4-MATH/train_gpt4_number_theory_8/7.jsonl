Then the four integers are $n, n+1, n+2,$ and $n+3$. Their product is $840$, so we have the equation $(n)(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)=840$.\n\nFirst, we notice that $840$ is divisible by $4$, so one of the four consecutive integers must be divisible by $4$. Since $840$ is also divisible by $3$, one of the four consecutive integers must be divisible by $3$. Thus, one of the four integers must be divisible by $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. The smallest such set of four consecutive integers is $9, 10, 11, 12$, but their product is greater than $840$. The next set of four consecutive integers that has a multiple of $12$ is $11, 12, 13, 14$, and their product is $(11)(12)(13)(14) = 240 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 3120$.

Finally, we try $(2^3, 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7) = (8, 105)$. The difference between these factors is $97$, which is still too large.\n\nThe next way to group the factors of $840$ is into three factors: $(2, 2^2 \\cdot 3, 5 \\cdot 7) = (2, 12, 35)$. The difference between the smallest and largest factors in this group is $33$, which is still too large. Finally, we try $(2 \\cdot 3, 2^2 \\cdot 5, 7) = (6, 20, 7)$.

Since 7 does not divide 2, 3, or 5, we can assign the next largest prime factor, 5, to the next largest integer, $n+2$. Now, we assign 3 to $n+1$ and the three factors of 2 to $n$.

We can rewrite $2000$ as $243 \\cdot 8 - 16 = 3^5 \\cdot 2^3 - 2^4$.\nSo, when we divide $2007$ by $81$, we get the same remainder as when we divide $2000+7$ by $81$. Since $2000$ is a multiple of $81$ (with $8$ left over), the remainder when dividing $2007$ by $81$ is the same as the remainder when dividing $7$ by $81$, which is $\\boxed{7}$.\nThe answer is 7"], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory"}
