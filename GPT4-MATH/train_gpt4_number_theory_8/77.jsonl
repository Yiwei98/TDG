{"question": "Mady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?", "answer": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nWe can represent the state of the boxes as a string of digits, where the $i^{\\text{th}}$ digit represents the number of balls in the $i^{\\text{th}}$ box. For example, after 3 steps, the state of the boxes is \"3000...\".\nWe notice that the process Mady follows is similar to counting in base 5, where adding a ball to a box is like incrementing the digit, and emptying a box is like carrying over to the next digit. The only difference is that each box can hold up to 4 balls instead of 5.\nSo, Mady's 2010th step is like adding 2010 in base 5, starting from the number \"1000...\". We perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n   1\n+2010\n-----\n  4023\n```\n\nSo, after Mady's 2010th step, the state of the boxes is \"4023...\".\nTherefore, the total number of balls in the boxes is $4 + 0 + 2 + 3 = \\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is 9.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can represent the state of the boxes with a base-4 number. For example, if the boxes have 3, 0, 1, and 2 balls, respectively, we can represent this state as the base-4 number 3012. When Mady places a ball in a box, it is equivalent to incrementing the base-4 number by 1. For example, if the current state is 3012, the next state will be 3013, and the state after that will be 3020 (since the first box is full).\n\nNow, we want to find the state after Mady's 2010th step. Since she starts at the state 0000 and increments the base-4 number at each step, the state after 2010 steps will be the base-4 representation of 2010. Converting 2010 to base-4, we get 13312.\n\nThus, after 2010 steps, there will be 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = $\\boxed{10}$ balls in the boxes.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can represent the state of the boxes by a string of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents an empty space and 1 represents a ball. For example, after the first step, the state is 1000. After the second step, the state is 2000. After the third step, the state is 3000. After the fourth step, the state is 4000 and we empty the first box, so the state is 0100. After the fifth step, the state is 1100. We continue this process.\n\nNotice that each step corresponds to incrementing the number represented by the string of digits in base 4. For example, 1000 in base 4 is 64 in base 10, and 2000 in base 4 is 128 in base 10. Therefore, we can find the state after the 2010th step by converting 2010 to base 4, which is 13322. This means there are 1+3+3+2+2 = 11 balls in the boxes after the 2010th step.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "Let's think step by step\nLet's first analyze the first few steps:\nStep 1: (1,0,0,0,...)\nStep 2: (2,0,0,0,...)\nStep 3: (3,0,0,0,...)\nStep 4: (0,1,0,0,...)\nStep 5: (1,1,0,0,...)\nStep 6: (2,1,0,0,...)\nStep 7: (3,1,0,0,...)\nStep 8: (0,0,1,0,...)\n\nWe can see that the number of balls in the first box cycles through the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3, while the number of balls in the other boxes increases by 1 each time the first box is emptied.\n\nNow, let's find the number of times the first box is emptied by the 2010th step. Since it cycles through 4 numbers, after 2008 steps, the first box would have been emptied 502 times (2008/4 = 502). So, at the 2009th step, there would be 1 ball in the first box, and at the 2010th step, there would be 2 balls in the first box.\n\nSince the first box was emptied 502 times, the second box would have 502 balls. Similarly, the third box would have 502/4 = 125 balls (since it gets filled every 4 times the first box is emptied), and the fourth box would have 125/4 = 31 balls (rounded down).\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls in the boxes after the 2010th step is 2 (first box) + 502 (second box) + 125 (third box) + 31 (fourth box) = 660. The answer is \\boxed{660}.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can think of this process in terms of base-4 numbers.\nAt the first step, we have \"1 ball\" in the first box, which we can represent as the base-4 number $1_4$.\nAt the second step, we have \"2 balls\" in the first box, which we can represent as the base-4 number $2_4$.\nAt the third step, we have \"3 balls\" in the first box, which we can represent as the base-4 number $3_4$.\nAt the fourth step, we have \"1 ball\" in the second box and \"0 balls\" in the first box, which we can represent as the base-4 number $10_4$.\nContinuing this process, we see that the number of balls in the boxes at each step corresponds to the base-4 representation of the step number.\n\nAt the $2010$th step, we want to find the base-4 representation of 2010. We have:\n\n$2010 = 4^4 + 3\\cdot4^3 + 2\\cdot4^2 + 2\\cdot4^1 + 2\\cdot4^0 = 16384 + 3072 + 128 + 32 + 2$\n\nSo the base-4 representation of 2010 is $13222_4$.\n\nThis means that at the end of the 2010th step, there is 1 ball in the fifth box, 3 balls in the fourth box, 2 balls in the third box, 2 balls in the second box, and 2 balls in the first box. The total number of balls in the boxes is $1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = \\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can think of this process as a base-4 counting system. Each box represents a digit in the base-4 system, and each ball represents an increment of one in that digit. When a box is full, it is emptied and the next box to the right is incremented by one. This is similar to how we carry over in our usual base-10 counting system.\n\nFor example, after the first step, we have one ball in the first box, which corresponds to the base-4 number 1. After the second step, we have two balls in the first box, which corresponds to the base-4 number 2, and so on. When the first box is full (after the fourth step), we empty it and place a ball in the second box, corresponding to the base-4 number 10.\n\nNow, we want to find the total number of balls in the boxes after Mady's 2010th step. Since 2010 in base-10 is equal to 13322 in base-4, the number of balls in the boxes after 2010 steps is 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = $\\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can represent the state of the boxes using a string of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents an empty box and 1 represents a box with one ball. For example, if the first box has 3 balls and the second box has 1 ball, the state is represented as 1110.\n\nNow, let's analyze the process. When Mady places a ball in the first box that still has room, she is essentially adding 1 to the string of 0s and 1s (in base 4). When she empties the boxes to the left, she is resetting the digits to the left of that box to 0. Thus, the process is equivalent to counting in base 4, where each step increments the number by 1.\n\nAt Mady's 2010th step, the base 4 representation of the number of balls in the boxes is equal to the base 4 representation of the number 2010. Converting 2010 to base 4, we get 133032. The total number of balls in the boxes is the sum of the digits in this base 4 representation, which is 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 12.\n\nSo, there are a total of $\\boxed{12}$ balls in the boxes as a result of Mady's 2010th step.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can represent the state of the boxes by a string of numbers, where the $i^{\\text{th}}$ number represents the number of balls in the $i^{\\text{th}}$ box. For example, after the first step, the state of the boxes is \"1\". After the second step, it is \"2\", and after the third step, it is \"3\". After the fourth step, Mady empties the first box and places a ball in the second box, so the state of the boxes is \"04\".\n\nWe can see that Mady's process is equivalent to counting in base 4, with the leftmost digit being the least significant digit. The first step corresponds to the number 1, the second step to the number 2, the third step to the number 3, and the fourth step to the number 10 (in base 4).\n\nThus, we want to find the state of the boxes after Mady's 2010th step, which corresponds to the number 2010 in base 4. Converting 2010 to base 4, we get $2010_{10} = 13322_4$.

To do this, we need to find the smallest $a$ and $b$ that make this equation true. Since $2a^2 = 3b^3$, both $a^2$ and $b^3$ must be divisible by both 2 and 3. The smallest perfect square that is divisible by 3 is $3^2 = 9$, and the smallest perfect cube that is divisible by 2 is $2^3 = 8$. So, let $a^2 = 9$ and $b^3 = 8$.

This is because 100 is divisible by 4, so any multiple of 100 will not affect the remainder when divided by 4.\n\nSimilarly, in base 2 (binary), we only need to consider the last two digits of the number when dividing by 4 (which is $100_2$ in binary). This is because $100_2$ is divisible by 4, so any multiple of $100_2$ will not affect the remainder when divided by 4.\n\nThe last two digits of the given binary number are $10_2$. Converting this to base 10, we get $2_{10}$.
