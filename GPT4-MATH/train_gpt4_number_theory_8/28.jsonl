So, $n = 2^3 = \\boxed{8}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $2n = a^2$ and $3n = b^3$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.\nWe can rewrite these equations as $n = \\frac{a^2}{2}$ and $n = \\frac{b^3}{3}$.\nSince both expressions are equal to $n$, we have $\\frac{a^2}{2} = \\frac{b^3}{3}$.\nNow, cross-multiply to get $3a^2 = 2b^3$.\n\nSince $3$ divides the left side, $3$ must also divide the right side, so $3$ must divide $b^3$. This means that $3$ must divide $b$. Let $b = 3c$ for some integer $c$. Substitute this into the equation to get $3a^2 = 2(3c)^3 = 54c^3$.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $3$ to get $a^2 = 18c^3$. Since $2$ divides the right side, $2$ must also divide the left side, so $2$ must divide $a^2$. This means that $2$ must divide $a$. Let $a = 2d$ for some integer $d$. Substitute this into the equation to get $(2d)^2 = 18c^3$ or $4d^2 = 18c^3$.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $2$ to get $2d^2 = 9c^3$. Since $2$ divides the left side, $2$ must also divide the right side, so $2$ must divide $9c^3$. But $2$ does not divide $9$, so $2$ must divide $c^3$, which means that $2$ must divide $c$. Let $c = 2e$ for some integer $e$. Substitute this into the equation to get $2d^2 = 9(2e)^3$ or $2d^2 = 72e^3$.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $2$ to get $d^2 = 36e^3$. Since $d^2$ is a perfect square, and $36$ is a perfect square, $e^3$ must also be a perfect square. The smallest possible value for $e$ that makes $e^3$ a perfect square is $e=1$. This gives us $d^2 = 36$, so $d = 6$.\n\nNow, we can work backwards to find $a$, $b$, and $n$. We have $a = 2d = 12$, $b = 3c = 3(2e) = 6$, and $n = \\frac{a^2}{2} = \\frac{12^2}{2} = \\boxed{72}$.\nThe answer is 72."], "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory"}
