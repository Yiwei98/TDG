Therefore, $n$ is a perfect square, say $n = m^2$.\n\nNow, the proper divisors of $n$ come in pairs that multiply to $n$. Since $n$ is a perfect square, it has an odd number of divisors, so there must be a proper divisor $d$ of $n$ that is not paired with another proper divisor. This means that $d^2 = n$.
