Now we just need to ensure that it is divisible by 3. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since the units digit is 5, we need the sum of the other two digits to be a multiple of 3. The smallest possible three-digit number with a 5 in the units place is 105, and the largest is 995. \n\nNow, we can list out the numbers that are divisible by 15 and have a 5 in the units place: 105, 135, 165, 195, 225, 255, 285, 315, 345, 375, 405, 435, 465, 495, 525, 555, 585, 615, 645, 675, 705, 735, 765, 795, 825, 855, 885, 915, 945, and 975.\n\nThere are a total of $\\boxed{30}$ such numbers.", "Let's think step by step\nSince the integer has a $5$ in the units place, it must be divisible by $5$. To be divisible by $15$, it must also be divisible by $3$. We can check the divisibility by $3$ by looking at the sum of the digits.\n\nA three-digit integer with a $5$ in the units place can be written as $100a + 10b + 5$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits. For this integer to be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits, $a + b + 5$, must be divisible by $3$.\n\nThe smallest such integer is $105$ (when $a = 1$ and $b = 0$), and the largest is $995$ (when $a = 9$ and $b = 9$). We will now count the number of integers in this range that are divisible by $15$.\n\nConsider the sequence of integers that are divisible by $15$ and have a $5$ in the units place: $105, 135, 165, \\dots, 975$. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $30$. To find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula for the last term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nLast Term = First Term + (Number of Terms - 1) \u00d7 Common Difference\n\nIn this case, $975 = 105 + (n - 1) \u00d7 30$. Solving for $n$, we get:\n\n$870 = (n - 1) \u00d7 30$\n\n$29 = n - 1$\n\n$n = 30$\n\nSo there are $\\boxed{30}$ positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$.", "Let's think step by step\nSince the integer has a $5$ in the units place, it must be divisible by $5$. To be divisible by $15$, it must also be divisible by $3$. If the three-digit integer is $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits, then the divisibility rule for $3$ states that $a + b + c$ must be a multiple of $3$. Since $c = 5$, we have $a + b + 5$ must be a multiple of $3$. Thus, $a + b$ must be a multiple of $3$ as well.\n\nThe smallest three-digit integer with a $5$ in the units place is $105$. The largest is $995$. We need to find the first and last multiples of $15$ in this range.\n\nThe first multiple of $15$ in this range is $105$, as $105$ is divisible by $15$. To find the last multiple of $15$ in this range, we can divide $995$ by $15$ and round down to the nearest integer. This gives us $66$. Thus, the last multiple of $15$ in this range is $66 \\times 15 = 990$.\n\nNow, we need to count how many multiples of $15$ there are between $105$ and $990$. Since every $15$th number is a multiple of $15$, we can subtract the first multiple ($105$) from the last multiple ($990$) and divide by $15$ to find the number of multiples:\n\n$\\frac{990 - 105}{15} = \\frac{885}{15} = 59$\n\nHowever, this only counts the multiples between $105$ and $990$. Since both $105$ and $990$ are also multiples of $15$, we need to add $2$ to include them:\n\n$59 + 2 = \\boxed{61}$\n\nThere are 61 positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$.", "Let's think step by step\nA number is divisible by 15 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.\nSince the units digit is 5, the number is divisible by 5.\nTo be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3.\nLet the three-digit integer be $100a + 10b + 5$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits.\nThe sum of the digits is $a + b + 5$.\nSince the number is divisible by 3, $a + b + 5$ must be divisible by 3.\nThere are 9 possible choices for $a$ (1 to 9) and 10 possible choices for $b$ (0 to 9).\nWe can make a table of the possible sums and see which are divisible by 3:\n\n```\n a | b | a+b+5 | Divisible by 3?\n---|---|-------|----------------\n 1 | 0 |   6   | Yes\n 1 | 1 |   7   | No\n 1 | 2 |   8   | No\n 1 | 3 |   9   | Yes\n 1 | 4 |  10   | No\n 1 | 5 |  11   | No\n 1 | 6 |  12   | Yes\n...\n 9 | 4 |  18   | Yes\n 9 | 5 |  19   | No\n 9 | 6 |  20   | No\n 9 | 7 |  21   | Yes\n 9 | 8 |  22   | No\n 9 | 9 |  23   | No\n```\n\nWe can see that for each value of $a$, there are 3 or 4 values of $b$ that result in a sum divisible by 3.\nFor $a = 1, 4, 7$, there are 4 values of $b$ that work, and for $a = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9$, there are 3 values of $b$ that work.\nSo, the total number of three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15 is $3(4) + 6(3) = 12 + 18 = \\boxed{30}$.\nThe answer is 30."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Number Theory"}
