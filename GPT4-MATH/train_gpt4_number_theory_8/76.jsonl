If $k$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, hence $k+n-1$ is odd, and $S_n$ cannot be a perfect square. Hence $k$ must be even. In particular, as $n<1000$, we have five choices for $k$, namely $k=0,2,4,6,8$.\nIf $k=0$, then $n+1$ is odd, so $k+n-1$ is odd, hence the largest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ has an odd exponent, so $S_n$ is not a perfect square.\nIn the other cases, note that $k+n-1$ is even, so the highest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ will be a perfect square.

Note that $g(x)$ is equivalent to finding the largest power of 2 that divides $x$. For example, $g(20) = 4$ because $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5$ and $g(16) = 16$ because $16 = 2^4$.

Thus, the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} g(k)$ is odd if and only if there are an odd number of blocks.\nNow, we want to find the largest $n < 1000$ such that the number of blocks in the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} g(k)$ is even. We can do this by counting the number of blocks for each $n$. For example, when $n = 1$, there is 1 block; when $n = 2$, there are 2 blocks; when $n = 3$, there are 4 blocks; and so on.

Since the number of blocks is always a power of 2, we want to find the largest $n < 1000$ such that $2^{n-1}$ is a power of 2. This occurs when $n - 1 = 2^k$ for some integer $k$.
