A photoelectric eye by the side of the road counts the number of cars that pass in one hour. Assuming that each car is 4 meters long and that the cars can travel at any speed, let $M$ be the maximum whole number of cars that can pass the photoelectric eye in one hour. Find the quotient when $M$ is divided by $10$.\n", "answer": "Let $n$ be the number of car lengths that separates each car. Then their speed is at most $15n$. Let a unit be the distance between the cars (front to front). Then the length of each unit is $4(n + 1)$. To maximize, in a unit, the CAR comes first, THEN the empty space. So at time zero, the car is right at the eye.\nHence, we count the number of units that pass the eye in an hour: $\\frac {15,000n\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{hour}}}{4(n + 1)\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{unit}}} = \\frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)}\\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$. We wish to maximize this.\nObserve that as $n$ gets larger, the $+ 1$ gets less and less significant, so we take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {15,000}{4} = 3750$\nNow, as the speeds are clearly finite, we can never actually reach $3750$ full UNITs. However, we only need to find the number of CARS. We can increase their speed so that the camera stops (one hour goes by) after the car part of the $3750$th unit has passed, but not all of the space behind it. Hence, $3750$ cars is possible, and the answer is $\\boxed{375}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nIn order to maximize the number of cars passing the photoelectric eye,\nwe need to minimize the distance between each car.\nThis occurs when the cars are traveling at a speed that is just over a multiple of 15 km/h,\nso that they maintain the minimum possible distance while still obeying the safety rule.\n\nLet's consider the case where the cars are traveling at 16 km/h.\nAt this speed, the distance between each car is 1 car length, or 4 meters.\nThus, there is a total of 8 meters between the back of one car and the back of the car behind it.\nSince the cars are traveling at 16 km/h, we can convert this to meters per hour by multiplying by 1000 (to convert km to meters) and then dividing by 60 (to convert hours to minutes):\n16 km/h * 1000 m/km = 16000 meters per hour.\n\nNow, we can determine how many cars pass the photoelectric eye in one hour by dividing the total distance traveled in one hour by the distance between the back of one car and the back of the car behind it:\n16000 meters per hour / 8 meters per car = 2000 cars per hour.\n\nFinally, we find the quotient when M is divided by 10: 2000 / 10 = $\\boxed{200}$.\nThe answer is 200.", "Let's think step by step\nWe want to maximize the number of cars that pass the photoelectric eye,\nso we want to minimize the distance between the cars.\nThe minimum distance between the cars occurs when the front of a car is exactly one car length behind the back of the car in front of it.\nThis occurs when the cars are traveling at 30 kilometers per hour.\nAt this speed, the cars are traveling at 30,000 meters per hour.\nSince each car is 4 meters long, the distance from the front of one car to the front of the next car is 8 meters.\nThus, in one hour, $30,000/8=3750$ cars pass the photoelectric eye.\nThe quotient when $M$ is divided by $10$ is $\\boxed{375}$.\nThe answer is 375", "Let's think step by step\nThe speed of the cars must be an integer multiple of $15$ kilometers per hour, so that the distance between the cars is an integer multiple of $4$ meters.
