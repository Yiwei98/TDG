When the first digit gets to 1, the next power of 9 will have 9 as its first digit again. This pattern repeats every 9 powers of 9.\n\nNow, we want to find how many powers of 9 in the set T have 9 as their leftmost digit.

We know that $9^0 = 1$, so it does not have 9 as its leftmost digit.\nHowever, notice that when we multiply a number with 9 as its leftmost digit by 9, the result will also have 9 as its leftmost digit.\nFor example, $9 \\times 9 = 81$, $81 \\times 9 = 729$, and so on.\n\nNow, let's see how many times we need to multiply by 9 to get from a 1-digit number to a 3817-digit number.\nSince $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits, we can write $9^{4000} = 9 \\times 10^{3816}$.\nTaking the logarithm base 9 of both sides, we get $4000 = 1 + 3816\\log_9{10}$.\nSolving for $\\log_9{10}$, we get $\\log_9{10} = \\frac{3999}{3816}$.\n\nNow, let's find how many times we need to multiply by 9 to get from a 1-digit number to a 2-digit number.\nThis is the same as finding the smallest integer $k$ such that $9^k \\ge 10$.\nTaking the logarithm base 9 of both sides, we get $k \\ge \\log_9{10}$.\nSince $\\log_9{10} = \\frac{3999}{3816}$, we have $k \\ge 2$.\n\nSimilarly, to find how many times we need to multiply by 9 to get from a 2-digit number to a 3-digit number, we need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $9^k \\ge 100$.\nTaking the logarithm base 9 of both sides, we get $k \\ge 2\\log_9{10}$.\nSince $2\\log_9{10} = \\frac{7998}{3816}$, we have $k \\ge 3$.\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the smallest integer $k$ such that $9^k$ has $n$ digits for any positive integer $n$.\n\nNow, for each power of 9 in the set $T$, we can find the number of digits it has and check if its leftmost digit is 9.\nSince we know that multiplying by 9 preserves the leftmost digit of 9, we only need to check the first power of 9 in each group of powers that have the same number of digits.\n\nFor example, we know that $9^2$ has 2 digits and its leftmost digit is 9, so all other powers of 9 that have 2 digits will also have 9 as their leftmost digit.\nSimilarly, we know that $9^3$ has 3 digits and its leftmost digit is 9, so all other powers of 9 that have 3 digits will also have 9 as their leftmost digit.\n\nContinuing this process, we can count the number of elements of $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit.\nSince there are 4001 elements in the set $T$, and we know that $9^0$ does not have 9 as its leftmost digit, there are $\\boxed{4000}$ elements of $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit.", "Let's think step by step\nFor a number to have 9 as its leftmost digit, it must be between $9 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$ and $10^n$, where $n$ is the number of digits in the number.\nTaking the logarithm base 9 of the inequality, we get $n-1 + \\log_9 9 \\le k \\le n + \\log_9 10$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, the number of integers in this interval is $\\lfloor n + \\log_9 10 \\rfloor - \\lceil n \\rceil + 1$.\nWe know that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits, so $9^{4000} < 10^{3816}$.\nTaking the logarithm base 9 of this inequality, we get $4000 < 3816 \\log_9 10$.\nThus, $3816 \\log_9 10 - 4000 \\approx 0.03$.\nSince there are 4001 elements in $T$, the number of elements with 9 as their leftmost digit is $4001 - \\lfloor 3816 \\log_9 10 \\rfloor = 4001 - 4000 = \\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is 1", "Let's think step by step\nWe know that $10^n \\le 9^k < 10^{n+1}$ for some integer $n$.
