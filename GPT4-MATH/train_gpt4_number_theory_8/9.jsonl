The base $7$ expression implies that $n = 49A + 7B + C$, and the base $11$ expression implies that $n = 121C + 11B + A$. Setting the two expressions equal to each other yields that $$n = 49A + 7B + C = 121C + 11B + A \\Longrightarrow 48A - 4B - 120C = 0.$$Isolating $B$, we get $$B = \\frac{48A - 120C}{4} = 12A - 30C = 6(2A - 5C).$$It follows that $B$ is divisible by $6$, and since $B$ is a base $7$ digit, then $B$ is either $0$ or $6$. If $B$ is equal to $0$, then $2A - 5C = 0 \\Longrightarrow 2A = 5C$, so $A$ must be divisible by $5$ and hence must be either $0$ or $5$.

Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $2^{11} - 1$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $2^{1001} - 1$.\n\nNow, let $c = 2^{1001} - 1$. We can write $c = (2^{11} - 1)(2^{990} + 2^{979} + \\dots + 2^{11} + 1)$, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nSince $2^{11} - 1$ is a factor of $c$, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $c$ is $2^{11} - 1$.
