Then $d$ divides both $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$. Since $d$ is a divisor of $ab$, it must also be a divisor of $a^3$ and $b^3$. Therefore, $d$ also divides $(a^3 + b^3) - a^3b^3(a+b) = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. Thus, $d$ divides $a+b$.\n\nNow, using the Euclidean Algorithm, we have $\\text{gcd}(a^3+b^3, ab) = \\text{gcd}((a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2), ab) = \\text{gcd}(a+b, ab)$. Therefore, $d = \\text{gcd}(a+b, ab) = 9$.\n\nSince $a+b$ is a multiple of 9 and $a-b=6$, we can write $a+b=9k$ and $a-b=6$ for some positive integer $k$. Adding these equations, we get $2a=9k+6$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 3. Let $a=3m$, then $b=9k-6-3m$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, we have $9k-6-3m>0$, or $3m<9k-6$. The smallest possible value of $k$ for which there exists a positive integer $m$ satisfying this inequality is $k=1$, for which we get $3m<3$. Thus, $m=1$, and $a=3$. Then $b=9(1)-6-3(1)=0$, which is not positive. Therefore, we need to try the next smallest value of $k$, which is $k=2$. For $k=2$, we have $3m<18-6=12$.

So, we can write $36 + 3ab = 9k$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, $3ab = 9(k-4)$, so $ab = 3(k-4)$.\n\nNow, we know that $a-b=6$, so $a = b+6$. Substituting this into the equation $ab = 3(k-4)$, we get $(b+6)b = 3(k-4)$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, $3$ must divide $b$ or $b+6$. If $3$ divides $b$, then $b=3n$ for some positive integer $n$. In this case, we have $(3n)(3n+6) = 9n(n+2) = 3(k-4)$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, $9$ divides $3(k-4)$, so $k-4$ is a multiple of $3$. But this means that $k$ is a multiple of $3$, which contradicts the fact that $\\text{gcd}(36 + 3ab, ab) = 9$.\n\nTherefore, $3$ must divide $b+6$, so $b+6 = 3m$ for some positive integer $m$. Then, we have $b(3m-6) = 3(k-4)$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, $3$ must divide $k-4$, so $k-4 = 3n$ for some positive integer $n$. Then, we have $b(3m-6) = 9n$, so $b(m-2) = 3n$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, $3$ must divide $m-2$, so $m-2 = 3p$ for some positive integer $p$.

Since $9$ is a divisor of both $a^2-ab+b^2$ and $ab$, it must also be a divisor of their difference, which is $a^2-2ab+b^2 = (a-b)^2$. We know that $a-b=6$, so $(a-b)^2 = 36$. Since $9$ is not a divisor of $36$, we must have that $a^2-ab+b^2=9$ and $ab=36$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $a-b=6$ to write $a=6+b$. Substituting this into the equation $ab=36$, we get $(6+b)b=36$. Expanding and rearranging, we have $b^2+6b-36=0$. Factoring, we get $(b+12)(b-3)=0$. Since $b$ is positive, we have $b=3$.

We can rewrite $a^3-b^3$ as $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2) = 6(a^2+ab+b^2)$.\nSo, we have $9k = 6(a^2+ab+b^2)$, which simplifies to $3k = 2(a^2+ab+b^2)$.\nSince the left side is divisible by 3, the right side must also be divisible by 3. This means that either $a$ or $b$ is divisible by 3.\nIf $a$ is divisible by 3, then $a = 3m$ for some positive integer $m$. Substituting this into $a-b = 6$, we get $3m - b = 6$.\nSince $b$ is positive, we have $m \\geq 3$. The smallest possible value of $m$ is 3, which gives us $a = 9$ and $b = 3$.\nHowever, this doesn't work because $\\text{gcd}(a^3-b^3, ab) = \\text{gcd}(9^3-3^3, 9\\cdot3) = \\text{gcd}(648, 27) = 27 \\neq 9$.\nSo, we must have $b$ divisible by 3.

Since $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)((a+b)^2-3ab)$, we have $\\text{gcd}\\left((a+b)^2-3ab, a'b'\\right) = 1$.\nWe are given that $a-b=6$, so $9a'-9b'=6$, which simplifies to $3a'-3b'=2$. Since $a'$ and $b'$ are integers, there is no solution for this equation. Therefore, we made a mistake in assuming that $g$ divides both $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow, let's try another approach. We know that $g$ divides $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$. Also, $g$ must divide $a^3+b^3-(a+b)ab = a^2b^2-3a^2b+2a^3$. Since $g$ divides $ab$, $g$ must also divide $a^2b^2-3a^2b+2a^3 - (ab)^2 = -a^2b^2+3a^2b-2a^3$. Thus, $g$ divides $a^3-b^3=6(a-b)$. Since $a-b=6$, $g$ must divide $a^3-b^3=6^3$.\n\nNow, let's find the prime factorization of $6^3$. We have $6^3 = 2^3\\cdot3^3$. We are given that $g=9$, which means $g$ must have a factor of $3^2$. Since $g$ divides $a^3-b^3$, $g$ must also divide $a-b=6$. Therefore, $g$ must have a factor of $2$ or $3$. Since $g$ already has a factor of $3^2$, it must have a factor of $2$. Thus, $g=2\\cdot3^2=18$.\n\nNow, we know that $18$ divides $a^3-b^3=6^3$. Thus, $a^3-b^3=18k$ for some positive integer $k$. Since $a-b=6$, we can use the difference of cubes factorization to get $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)=18k$. Now, we have $(6)(a^2+ab+b^2)=18k$. Dividing both sides by $6$, we get $a^2+ab+b^2=3k$.\n\nNow, we want to minimize $b$. Since $a-b=6$, we can write $a=b+6$. Substituting this into the equation we just derived, we get $(b+6)^2+(b+6)b+b^2=3k$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $3b^2+18b+36=3k$. Dividing both sides by $3$, we get $b^2+6b+12=k$. Now, we want to minimize $b$. The smallest possible value for $k$ is $1$, which gives us $b^2+6b+11=0$. Factoring, we get $(b+1)(b+5)=0$.
