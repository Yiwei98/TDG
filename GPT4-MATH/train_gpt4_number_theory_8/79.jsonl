Compute the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$.", "answer": "We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$. The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does. Since $a_{44}$ ends in $4$, it gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n\nFor the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 9, note that  \\begin{align*}\na_{44}&=44+43\\cdot 10^2 + 42 \\cdot 10^4+41\\cdot 10^6+\\cdots+10\\cdot10^{68}\\\\\n&\\qquad+9\\cdot 10^{70}+8\\cdot 10^{71}+\\cdots + 1\\cdot 10^{78} \\\\ &\\equiv 44+43+42+\\cdots+1\\pmod{9},\n\\end{align*}since $10^n\\equiv 1^n\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. In words, this calculation shows that we can sum groups of digits in any way we choose to check for divisibility by 9. For example, 1233 is divisible by 9 since $12+33=45$ is divisible by 9. This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nWe are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.

Since 45 is divisible by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9 to find the remainder of $a_{44}$ when divided by 9. The remainder of each term when divided by 9 is just the sum of its digits. Thus, the remainder of $a_{44}$ when divided by 9 is the sum of all the integers from 1 to 44, which is $\\frac{44 \\cdot 45}{2} = 22 \\cdot 45$. This means $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nNow we need to find the remainder of $a_{44}$ when divided by 5. Since the last digit of each term is not affected by the other terms when adding, we can find the remainder of each term when divided by 5 and then find the remainder of the sum. The remainders of the terms when divided by 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, ..., 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0. We can see that the remainders repeat every 5 terms, so we can just find the remainder of the sum of the first 5 remainders, which is 10, and then multiply by the number of complete repetitions, which is 8. This gives us a remainder of 80 when divided by 5. However, we still have the remainders of the last 4 terms to consider. These are 1, 2, 3, and 4, which sum to 10. So the remainder of $a_{44}$ when divided by 5 is $80 + 10 = 90$, which is equivalent to 0.\n\nSince $a_{44}$ is divisible by both 9 and 5, it must be divisible by 45.

{"question": "How many even divisors does $7!$ have?", "answer": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.
