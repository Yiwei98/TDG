We are given that $x+y=30$ and $2x-3y=5$. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.\n\nUsing substitution, we can solve the first equation for $x$ to get $x=30-y$. Substituting this into the second equation gives us $2(30-y)-3y=5$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $60-2y-3y=5$, or $-5y=-55$. Dividing by $-5$, we find that $y=11$. Now we can substitute this back into our equation for $x$ to get $x=30-11=19$. \n\nThe positive difference between the two numbers is $19-11=\\boxed{8}$. The answer is 8."], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra"}
