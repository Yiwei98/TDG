There are eight vertices on the cube, so we find that the sum 1001 is equal to $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def.$$ For any two faces adjacent at a vertex with $a$, the same two faces are adjacent to a vertex with $d$. Furthermore, any three adjacent faces must contain one of $a$ or $d$. Therefore, every term contains $a$ or $d$, and the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $d$. Considering the expression as a polynomial in $a$ (with the remaining variables fixed), we observe that $P(-d)=0$. Therefore, $a+d$ divides the given expression. Similarly, $b+e$ and $c+f$ divide the given expression as well. Therefore, $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def = k(a+d)(b+e)(c+f).$$ Here, since both sides are of degree three in their variables, $k$ must be a constant, which is easily seen to be $1$.\n\nIt follows that $(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.

Also, note that the left side of the equation is even, so $S(xy)$ must be odd. Since $1001$ is odd, $S(xy) - 1001$ must be even. Thus, the left side of the equation is divisible by $2$. However, the only way for the left side to be divisible by $2$ is if both $x(a^2 + b^2)$ and $y(c^2 + d^2)$ are even. This implies that $a^2 + b^2$ and $c^2 + d^2$ are both even, which means $a$ and $b$ must have the same parity, and $c$ and $d$ must have the same parity.\n\nNow, we can use trial and error to find possible values for $a, b, c,$ and $d$. Since $a$ and $b$ have the same parity, and $c$ and $d$ have the same parity, we can try setting $a = b = 1$ and $c = d = 2$.

Eventually, we find that $x = 5$ and $y = 13$ give us a solution:\n\n$2(5) + 8(13) = S(5)(13) - 1001$\n\n$114 = S(65) - 1001$\n\n$S = \\frac{114 + 1001}{65} = \\frac{1115}{65} = 17$\n\nThus, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is $\\boxed{17}$.", "Let's think step by step\nLet $a, b, c, d, e, f$ be the numbers written on the faces of the cube.
