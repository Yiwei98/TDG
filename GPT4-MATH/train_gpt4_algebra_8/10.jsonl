Therefore, we must have $20 - 2k = n^2$ and $20 + 2k = m^2$ for some positive integers $n$ and $m$.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $4k = m^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n)$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, both $m - n$ and $m + n$ must be even. Let $m - n = 2p$ and $m + n = 2q$ for some positive integers $p$ and $q$. Then, $k = pq$.\n\nSolving for $m$ and $n$ in terms of $p$ and $q$, we get $m = p + q$ and $n = q - p$. Substituting these into the equation $20 - 2k = n^2$, we get $20 - 2pq = (q - p)^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we have $(p + q)^2 - 4pq = 20$, or $(p - q)^2 = 20 - 4pq$.\n\nSince $20 - 4pq$ must be a perfect square, we can list the possible values of $(p, q)$: $(1, 5)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$, and $(5, 1)$. The corresponding values of $k = pq$ are $5$, $6$, $6$, and $5$, respectively.
