Each day, the number of students who know the secret doubles. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. We want to find the day when 1023 students know the secret.\n\nThe total number of students who know the secret after $n$ days is given by the formula $1(2^n - 1)$, where $n$ is the number of days.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ such that $1(2^n - 1) \\ge 1023$. \n\n$2^n - 1 \\ge 1023$\n\n$2^n \\ge 1024$\n\nSince $2^{10} = 1024$, we have $n \\ge 10$.\n\nSo, it will take 10 days for 1023 students to know the secret. Since it started on Monday, after 10 days, it will be $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.\nThe answer is Thursday.", "Let's think step by step\nOn Monday, 1 person (Jessica) knows the secret.\nOn Tuesday, $1+2=3$ people know the secret.\nOn Wednesday, $3+2^2=7$ people know the secret.\nIn general, on day $n$, $2^n-1$ people know the secret (this follows from the sum of a geometric series).\n\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ such that $2^n-1\\geq 1023$.\nSince $2^{10}=1024$, we have $2^{10}-1=1023$. Thus, $n=10$.\n\nJessica started on Monday, so 10 days later is $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Algebra"}
