{"question": "Each of Natalie's blueberry bushes yields eight containers of blueberries. If she can trade five containers of blueberries for two zucchinis, how many bushes does Natalie need to pick in order to have forty-eight zucchinis?", "answer": "We know the following two equations: \\begin{align*}\n1\\text{ bush} &= 8\\text{ containers}\\\\\n5\\text{ containers} &= 2\\text{ zucchinis}.\n\\end{align*} To find the value of 48 zucchinis in terms of bushes, we multiply by fractions equal to 1 where the numerator and denominator are in different units, canceling units as we go. Thus, we set up the following equation to find our answer: $48\\text{ zucchinis} = 48\\text{ zucchinis}\\times \\frac{5\\text{ containers}}{2\\text{ zucchinis}}\\times\\frac{1 \\text{ bush}}{8\\text{ containers}}=\\boxed{15} \\text{ bushes}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to find how many containers of blueberries Natalie needs to trade for 48 zucchinis.\nSince five containers of blueberries can be traded for two zucchinis, we can set up a proportion:\n$\\frac{5 \\text{ containers}}{2 \\text{ zucchinis}} = \\frac{x \\text{ containers}}{48 \\text{ zucchinis}}$\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=120$ containers of blueberries.\nNow, since each bush yields eight containers of blueberries, we can divide the number of containers needed by the number of containers per bush:\n$\\frac{120 \\text{ containers}}{8 \\text{ containers/bush}} = 15 \\text{ bushes}$\nSo, Natalie needs to pick $\\boxed{15}$ bushes to have forty-eight zucchinis.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to find out how many containers of blueberries Natalie needs to trade for 48 zucchinis.\nSince 5 containers of blueberries can be traded for 2 zucchinis, we can set up a proportion to find the number of containers needed for 48 zucchinis:\n$\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{x}{48}$, where $x$ is the number of containers needed.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=120$ containers of blueberries.\n\nNow, since each of Natalie's blueberry bushes yields 8 containers of blueberries, we can divide the total number of containers needed by the number of containers per bush to find out how many bushes she needs to pick:\n$\\frac{120}{8} = \\boxed{15}$ bushes.\nThe answer is 15.", "Let's think step by step\nNatalie wants to have 48 zucchinis, and she can trade 5 containers of blueberries for 2 zucchinis.\nSo, she needs $(48/2)*5=120$ containers of blueberries to get 48 zucchinis.\nEach bush yields 8 containers of blueberries, so she needs to pick $120/8=\\boxed{15}$ bushes to have enough blueberries to trade for 48 zucchinis.\nThe answer is 15", "Let's think step by step\nNatalie needs to trade for 48 zucchinis.\nSince she gets 2 zucchinis for every 5 containers of blueberries, she needs 48/2 = 24 sets of 5 containers of blueberries.\nSo, she needs 24*5 = 120 containers of blueberries.\nEach bush yields 8 containers of blueberries, so she needs to pick 120/8 = 15 bushes.\nThe answer is 15.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to find out how many containers of blueberries Natalie needs to trade for 48 zucchinis.\nSince 5 containers of blueberries can be traded for 2 zucchinis, we can set up a proportion: $\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{x}{48}$, where $x$ is the number of containers needed.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 48 = 120$ containers of blueberries.\n\nNow, we know that each bush yields 8 containers of blueberries, so to get 120 containers, Natalie needs to pick $\\frac{120}{8} = \\boxed{15}$ bushes.\nThe answer is 15.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we need to find out how many containers of blueberries Natalie needs to get 48 zucchinis.\nSince 5 containers of blueberries can be traded for 2 zucchinis, we can set up a proportion: $\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{x}{48}$, where $x$ is the number of containers of blueberries needed.\nCross-multiplying, we get $5 \\cdot 48 = 2x$.
