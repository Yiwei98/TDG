This means that the point $(a,b)$ is the point on the line $y=-5x+18$ that is closest to the cheese at $(12,10)$. \n\nThe shortest distance between a point and a line is the perpendicular distance. Therefore, the line segment from $(12,10)$ to $(a,b)$ is perpendicular to the line $y=-5x+18$. The slope of the line $y=-5x+18$ is $-5$. Since the line segment from $(12,10)$ to $(a,b)$ is perpendicular to this line, its slope is the negative reciprocal of $-5$, which is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nNow we have the slope and a point on the line segment, so we can find the equation of the line containing the line segment from $(12,10)$ to $(a,b)$. Using point-slope form, we get $y-10=\\frac{1}{5}(x-12)$.\n\nSince the point $(a,b)$ lies on both lines, it must satisfy both equations.
