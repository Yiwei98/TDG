Then, $ab - 4a - 4b = 0$, or $a(b-4) = 4(b-4)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, we have that $a$ must be a multiple of 4. Let $a = 4k$, where $k$ is an integer. Then, $4k(b-4) = 4(b-4)$, so $kb = 1$. Since $k$ and $b$ are integers, this means that $k = 1$ and $b = 1$. Thus, the only possible value for $a$ is $4(1) = 4$. This gives us a right triangle with legs of length 4 and 5, and an area of $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(5) = 10$.

We can rearrange this equation as $ab - 4a - 4b = 0$, or $(a-4)(b-4) = 16$.\n\nNow we consider the possible integer factors of 16: $(1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (8,2),$ and $(16,1)$. For each pair of factors, we can set $a-4$ equal to one factor and $b-4$ equal to the other factor, then solve for $a$ and $b$. This gives us the following possibilities for $(a,b)$: $(5,20), (6,12), (8,8), (12,6),$ and $(20,5)$. Note that the $(8,8)$ case does not give us a right triangle, since the legs are equal and the triangle is isosceles. For the other cases, the areas of the triangles are $\\frac{1}{2}(5)(20)=50, \\frac{1}{2}(6)(12)=36, \\frac{1}{2}(12)(6)=36,$ and $\\frac{1}{2}(20)(5)=50$.

Then the area of the triangle is $(1/2)ab$, and the sum of the lengths of its legs is $a+b$. The condition of the problem is that $(1/2)ab = 2(a+b)$. Clearing the fractions, we get $ab = 4(a+b)$. Rearranging, we have $ab - 4a - 4b = 0$, or $ab - 4a - 4b + 16 = 16$. Factoring, we get $(a-4)(b-4) = 16$. Now we consider the pairs of factors of 16:\n\n1. $(1, 16)$: This gives $a-4=1$ and $b-4=16$, so $a=5$, $b=20$.
