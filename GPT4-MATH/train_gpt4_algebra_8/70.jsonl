First we note that $a$ must be $7$ or $-7$, since the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(ax+b)^2$ is $a^2$, and we need this to equal $49$. Since we are given that $a>0$, we reject $-7$ and select $a=7$.\n\nNow we want $49x^2+56x-64$ to have the same coefficient of $x$ as $(7x+b)^2$. Since the coefficient of $x$ in $(7x+b)^2$ is $14b$, we solve $56 = 14b$ to obtain $b=4$. Therefore, $49x^2+56x-64$ agrees with $(7x+4)^2$, except that the constant term is different.
