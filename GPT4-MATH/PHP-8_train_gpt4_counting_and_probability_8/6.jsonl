Now we have a row of 10 chairs, and we want to count the number of subsets that do not contain three adjacent chairs. However, we have to be careful about the cases where the first and last chairs are both in the subset, since they are adjacent in the circle.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of subsets of a row of $n$ chairs that do not contain three adjacent chairs. For a row of $n$ chairs, the last chair can either be in the subset or not. If it is not, then we have $a_{n-1}$ ways to choose the subset. If it is in the subset, then the second-to-last chair must not be in the subset, so we have $a_{n-2}$ ways to choose the subset. Thus, $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\nWe have $a_1 = 2$ (either the chair is in the subset or not) and $a_2 = 4$ (all subsets except the one with both chairs). Using the recursion, we find $a_{10} = 144$. However, this counts the cases where both the first and last chairs are in the subset, which we must exclude. There are $a_8 = 34$ such cases (since the first and last chairs are in the subset, we must choose a subset of the remaining 8 chairs that do not contain three adjacent chairs). So, there are $144 - 34 = 110$ subsets for the straightened row of chairs that do not contain three adjacent chairs.\n\nNow, we subtract this from the total number of subsets to get the number of subsets that contain at least three adjacent chairs: $2^{10} - 110 = 1024 - 110 = \\boxed{914}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use complementary counting to solve this problem. We will first find the number of subsets that do not contain three adjacent chairs, and then subtract this from the total number of subsets to find the number of subsets with at least three adjacent chairs.\n\nConsider the chairs as vertices of a decagon. To avoid having three adjacent chairs, we can only select at most two consecutive chairs at a time. We can think of this as a sequence of 0s and 1s, where a 0 represents an unselected chair, and a 1 represents a selected chair. For example, the sequence 1100100101 represents selecting chairs 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10.\n\nWe will first find the number of such sequences with no consecutive 1s. To do this, we can split the sequence into five \"blocks\" of two chairs each. We can then distribute the remaining five chairs to these blocks. This is equivalent to distributing five identical objects into five distinct boxes, which can be done in ${9\\choose4} = 126$ ways.\n\nHowever, we have also counted the sequences where there are three consecutive 0s. To correct for this, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. There are 10 ways to have a sequence with three consecutive 0s (one for each starting position of the 000 block). If there are two disjoint 000 blocks, there are 5 ways to arrange them. There is only one way to have three disjoint 000 blocks. So, by the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, there are $10 - 5 + 1 = 6$ sequences with at least one block of three consecutive 0s.\n\nTherefore, there are $126 - 6 = 120$ sequences with no three consecutive 1s.
