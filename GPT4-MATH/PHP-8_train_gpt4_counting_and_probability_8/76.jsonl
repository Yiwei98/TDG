If we build the string from the beginning, we have different possibilities to check.  For example, the second digit is 9, but the third digit could be 3 or 5.  However, no units digit appears more than once, so if we build the string in reverse then the order is determined.  If the 2002nd digit is 9, then the 2001st digit is 1, the 2000th digit is 3, the 1999th digit is 9, etc.  Therefore, the first digit would be 9.  So if the first digit is 1, then the final digit cannot be 9.  If the 2002nd digit is 8, the the 2001st digit is 3, the 2000th digit is 9, the 1999th digit is 1, the 1998th digit is 3, etc.  In this case, the first digit is 1, so the maximum possible last digit is $\\boxed{8}$.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find all two-digit multiples of 19 and 31: 19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 31, 62, and 93. We notice that the last digit of each multiple is different. Since the first digit is 1, the second digit must be 9, and the only two-digit multiple of 19 or 31 that starts with 19 is 19. Thus, the first two digits are 19. The next two-digit multiple must start with a 9, and the only option is 95. Continuing this process, we have the following string of digits:\n\n19 95 57 76 62 38 19 95 57 76 62 38 ... 19 95 57 76 62 38\n\nThis string repeats every 12 digits.

From this point, we must have a 5 as the next digit, but there are no multiples of 19 or 31 that start with 95, so the first two digits cannot be 19.\n\nIf the first two digits are 95, then the next digit must be 5, and the next two digits must be 57. Continuing this pattern, we see that the string consists of alternating 95 and 57 pairs.\n\nSince there are 2002 digits in the string, there are 1001 pairs of digits.

If 1 is followed by 9, the next digit must be 5 (from 95), followed by 7 (from 57), and so on. This creates a repeating pattern of 1957. However, if 1 is followed by 3, the next digit must be 1 (from 31), and we are back at the beginning.\n\nNow, we need to check how many times the pattern 1957 repeats in a 2002-digit string. Since 1957 has 4 digits, the pattern repeats 2002/4 = 500 times, with 2 digits remaining.

Notice that the last digit of the $i$th multiple of 19 is the same as the last digit of the $i$th multiple of 31. Thus, the last digit of the $(i+1)$th multiple of 19 is the same as the last digit of the $(i+1)$th multiple of 31. This means that if the first two digits of the string form a multiple of 19, then the next two digits must also form a multiple of 19. The same is true for multiples of 31.\n\nSince the first digit of the string is 1, the first two digits of the string must form a multiple of 19 or 31. The only possibility is 19, which is a multiple of 19. Thus, the next two digits must also form a multiple of 19. The only possibility is 38.

So the first pair must be 13.\n\nNow we build the string, starting with 13:\n13 -> 31 -> 12 -> 24 -> 48 -> 89 -> 93 -> 36 -> 62 -> 29 -> 57 -> 71 -> 19 -> 95 -> 57 -> 71 -> 19 -> 95 -> ...\n\nWe see a pattern: 13 -> 31 -> 12 -> 24 -> 48 -> 89 -> 93 -> 36 -> 62 -> 29 -> 57 -> 71 -> 19 -> 95 -> 57 -> 71 -> 19 -> 95 -> ...\n\nThe cycle repeats every 8 pairs, and 2002 is divisible by 8, so the last digit will be the same as the last digit of the 8th pair in the cycle, which is $\\boxed{6}$.", "Let's think step by step\nList out the two-digit multiples of 19 and 31: 19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 31, 62, 93.\nWe can then list out the possible digits that can follow each digit 1 through 9:\n1: 9\n2: 3\n3: 1, 8\n4: 9\n5: 7\n6: 2\n7: 6\n8: 1\n9: 3, 5\n\nWe can see that the only possible digit that can follow 1 is 9, so the second digit must be 9.

Since there are ${7\\choose3}=35$ ways to choose any three members, the probability of choosing two co-presidents and one other member in the second club is $\\frac{105}{35}=3$.\n\nIn the third club with 8 members, there are ${8\\choose2}=28$ ways to choose two co-presidents and ${6\\choose1}=6$ ways to choose one other member. So, there are a total of $28\\times6=168$ ways to choose two co-presidents and one other member. Since there are ${8\\choose3}=56$ ways to choose any three members, the probability of choosing two co-presidents and one other member in the third club is $\\frac{168}{56}=3$.\n\nFinally, we can find the overall probability by multiplying the probability of selecting each club with the probability of selecting two co-presidents and one other member in that club, and then summing these products:\n\nOverall Probability $= \\frac{1}{4}\\times3 + \\frac{7}{20}\\times3 + \\frac{2}{5}\\times3 = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{21}{20} + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{21}{20} + \\frac{24}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{45}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{12}{4}} = 3$.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "Let's think step by step\nWe consider each club separately.\nFor the club with 5 students, there are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose 3 students to give books to,\nand there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose 2 co-presidents and 1 other student to give books to.\nSo the probability that we give books to both co-presidents in the club with 5 students is $3/10$.\nSimilarly, for the club with 7 students, the probability is $\\binom{5}{3}/\\binom{7}{3}=10/35=2/7$,\nand for the club with 8 students, the probability is $\\binom{6}{3}/\\binom{8}{3}=20/56=5/14$.\nSince we are equally likely to choose any of the clubs, the overall probability is the average of these probabilities,\nwhich is $\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}+\\frac{2}{7}+\\frac{5}{14}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{42}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{17}{42}.", "Let's think step by step\nFirst, we find the probability of selecting each club: the probability of selecting the first club is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the probability of selecting the second club is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability of selecting the third club is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNext, we find the probability of selecting two co-presidents and one other member from each club, given that we have selected that club:\n\n1. For the first club with 5 students, there are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose 3 students. Out of these, there are $\\binom{2}{2}\\binom{3}{1}=3$ ways to choose both co-presidents and one other member. So, the conditional probability for the first club is $\\frac{3}{10}$.\n2. For the second club with 7 students, there are $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose 3 students. Out of these, there are $\\binom{2}{2}\\binom{5}{1}=5$ ways to choose both co-presidents and one other member. So, the conditional probability for the second club is $\\frac{5}{35}=\\frac{1}{7}$.\n3.
