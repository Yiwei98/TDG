To avoid making two faces touch, we cannot have the arrangement HT. Thus, all possible configurations must be a string of tails followed by a string of heads, since after the first H no more tails can appear. The first H can occur in a maximum of eight times different positions, and then there is also the possibility that it doesn\u2019t occur at all, for $9$ total configurations.

We can form an arrangement of $n + 1$ coins by taking an arrangement of $n$ coins and inserting a new coin in one of the $n + 1$ spaces between and to the sides of the existing coins. If we insert a coin between two face-to-face coins, then there is only one way to insert it so that no two adjacent coins are face to face. Otherwise, we can insert the new coin in either orientation. Thus, if an arrangement of $n$ coins has $k$ pairs of face-to-face coins, then there are $2(n - k) + k = n + k + 1$ ways to insert a new coin. Since an arrangement of $n$ coins has $n - a_n$ pairs of face-to-face coins, it follows that $a_{n + 1} = a_n + n + 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$.
