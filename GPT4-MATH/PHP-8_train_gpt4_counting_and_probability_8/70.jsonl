Using the same reasoning, there are $12 - 9 = 3$ dogs that can stay, rollover, but not sit, and $17 - 9 = 8$ dogs that can sit, stay, but not rollover.\n\n[asy]unitsize(50);\nimport graph;\npair A = (0,-1); pair B = (sqrt(3)/2,1/2); pair C = (-sqrt(3)/2,1/2);\ndraw(Circle(A,1.2) ^^ Circle(B,1.2) ^^ Circle(C,1.2));\nlabel(\"13\",A); label(\"9\",B); label(\"24\",C); label(\"$9$\",(0,0)); label(\"$8$\",(B+C)/2); label(\"$3$\",(A+B)/2); label(\"$9$\",(A+C)/2);\nlabel(\"Sit\",2.4C,C); label(\"Stay\",2.4B,B); label(\"Roll Over\", 2.4A,A);[/asy]\n\nSo now we know how many dogs can do multiple tricks, and exactly what tricks they can do. Since $50$ dogs can sit, $9$ dogs can sit and rollover only, $8$ dogs can sit and stay only, and $9$ dogs can do all three tricks, the remaining dogs that can't do multiple tricks can only sit, and there are $50 - 9 - 8 - 9 = 24$ of these. Using the same reasoning, we find that $29 - 3 - 8 - 9 = 9$ dogs can only stay and $34 - 9 - 3 - 9 = 13$ dogs can only roll over.\n\nSince $9$ dogs can do no tricks, we can add that to each category in the Venn Diagram to find that there are a total of $9 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 24 + 13 + 9 + 9 = \\boxed{84}$ dogs.", "generated_answer": ["Let's think step by step\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the total number of dogs in the school.\nThe number of dogs that can do at least one trick is the sum of the number of dogs that can do each individual trick minus the number of dogs that can do each pair of tricks, plus the number of dogs that can do all three tricks.\nSo, the number of dogs that can do at least one trick is $(50 + 29 + 34) - (17 + 12 + 18) + 9 = 113 - 47 + 9 = 75$.\nSince there are 9 dogs that can do none of the tricks, the total number of dogs in the school is $75 + 9 = \\boxed{84}$.\nThe answer is 84", "Let's think step by step\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the number of dogs that can sit, $T$ the number that can stay, and $R$ the number that can roll over.\nWe are given that $S = 50$, $T = 29$, and $R = 34$.\nLet $ST$ be the number of dogs that can sit and stay, $SR$ the number that can sit and roll over, and $TR$ the number that can stay and roll over.\nWe are given that $ST = 17$, $SR = 18$, and $TR = 12$.\nLet $STR$ be the number of dogs that can do all three tricks, and $N$ the number that can do none.\nWe are given that $STR = 9$ and $N = 9$.\n\nWe want to find the total number of dogs in the school, which is the number of dogs that can do at least one trick plus the number of dogs that can do none.\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of dogs that can do at least one trick is:\n$S + T + R - ST - SR - TR + STR = 50 + 29 + 34 - 17 - 18 - 12 + 9 = 75$.\n\nSo, the total number of dogs in the school is the number of dogs that can do at least one trick plus the number of dogs that can do none:\n$75 + 9 = \\boxed{84}$.\nThe answer is 84.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the total number of dogs in the school.\nLet $S$ be the number of dogs that can sit, $T$ be the number of dogs that can stay, and $R$ be the number of dogs that can roll over.\nWe are given the following information:\n$S = 50$\n$T = 29$\n$R = 34$\n$S \\cap T = 17$\n$T \\cap R = 12$\n$S \\cap R = 18$\n$S \\cap T \\cap R = 9$\n$N = 9$ (number of dogs that can do none of the tricks)\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we can find the total number of dogs in the school as follows:\n\nTotal dogs = $(S + T + R) - (S \\cap T + T \\cap R + S \\cap R) + (S \\cap T \\cap R) + N$\n\nTotal dogs = $(50 + 29 + 34) - (17 + 12 + 18) + 9 + 9$\n\nTotal dogs = $(113) - (47) + 18$\n\nTotal dogs = $66 + 18$\n\nTotal dogs = $\\boxed{84}$\n\nSo, there are 84 dogs in the school.", "Let's think step by step\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to solve this problem.\nThe total number of dogs is the sum of the number of dogs that can do each trick minus the number of dogs that can do each pair of tricks plus the number of dogs that can do all three tricks plus the number of dogs that can do none of the tricks.\n\nLet A be the number of dogs that can sit, B be the number of dogs that can stay, and C be the number of dogs that can roll over.\nWe have A = 50, B = 29, and C = 34.\nThe number of dogs that can sit and stay is 17, so A \u2229 B = 17.\nThe number of dogs that can stay and roll over is 12, so B \u2229 C = 12.\nThe number of dogs that can sit and roll over is 18, so A \u2229 C = 18.\nThe number of dogs that can do all three tricks is 9, so A \u2229 B \u2229 C = 9.\nThe number of dogs that can do none of the tricks is also 9.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we find the total number of dogs in the school:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + B \u2229 C + A \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C + None\nTotal = 50 + 29 + 34 - (17 + 12 + 18) + 9 + 9\nTotal = 113 - 47 + 18\nTotal = 66 + 18\nTotal = 84\n\nSo, there are 84 dogs in the school.
