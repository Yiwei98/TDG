We can do this by expanding each term and picking out the coefficients of $x^{10}$: \\[\\begin{aligned} (1+x^2)(1+x^3)^3 &= (1+x^2)(1+3x^3+3x^6+x^9) \\\\ &= 1 + x^2 + 3x^3 + 3x^5 + 3x^6 + x^8 + x^9 + 3x^{11} + 3x^{13} + x^{15}. \\end{aligned}\\] The coefficient of $x^{10}$ is 0, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ ways for Diane to arrange 10 cents worth of postage in a row across the top of an envelope.", "Let's think step by step\nWe use casework to count the number of arrangements for each possible combination of stamps that add up to 10 cents:\n\nCase 1: One 10-cent stamp.
