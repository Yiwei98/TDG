Note that $k$ must be less than $n/2$ since the path turns counterclockwise at an angle of less than 180 degrees at each vertex.\n\nNow, consider the path we draw when creating the star. We visit every vertex exactly once before returning to the starting vertex. In other words, we can reach every vertex by moving $k$ steps counterclockwise from any other vertex.
