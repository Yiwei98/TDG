We can place those ten marbles in any of 6 \"boxes\": To the left of the first green marble, to the right of the first but left of the second, etc. up until to the right of the last.

Since there are 4 digits in each of the next 1000 integers, we can find that 678/4 = 169 with a remainder of 2. This means that the 679th digit is the 2nd digit of the 170th number in the next 1000 integers. The 170th number in the next 1000 integers is 1000 + 170 = 1170, so the last three digits Albert wrote are $\\boxed{170}$.", "Let's think step by step\nAlbert writes one 1-digit number, nine 2-digit numbers, and ninety 3-digit numbers that have a first digit of 1. This is a total of $1+2(9)+3(90)=1+18+270=289$ digits. He writes the 1-digit number in the first digit, the 2-digit numbers in the next $18$ digits, and the 3-digit numbers in the next $270$ digits. Thus, the $289$th digit is the first digit of the first 4-digit number that has a first digit of 1, which is 1000. Since the $1000$th digit is the third digit of 1000, the $998$th and $999$th digits are the first and second digits of 1000, respectively. Thus, the three-digit number formed by the last three digits he wrote is $\\boxed{000}$.", "Let's think step by step\nAlbert writes one 1-digit number, ten 2-digit numbers, and 100 3-digit numbers.\nHe writes $1+20+300=321$ digits in these numbers.\nHe then writes 1000 4-digit numbers, 10000 5-digit numbers, and so on.\nSince he writes 4000 digits in the 4-digit numbers, he stops in the middle of the 4-digit numbers.\nHe writes $321+4000=4321$ digits in all, so his 1000th digit is the 321st digit of the 4-digit numbers.\nThe 321st digit is the first digit of the 108th 4-digit number.\nThus, the 998th, 999th, and 1000th digits are $\\boxed{108}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe first count the number of digits in the numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and so on, until we reach or exceed 1000 digits.\nThere is 1 one-digit number, which uses 1 digit.\nThere are 9 two-digit numbers, which use 18 digits.\nThere are 90 three-digit numbers, which use 270 digits.\nThere are 900 four-digit numbers, which use 3600 digits.\nAt this point, we have reached 1000 digits, so we know that the 1000th digit is in a four-digit number.\nThe first three-digit number on the list is 100, which has digits 1, 0, and 0.\nThe 1000th digit is the 1000 - 1 - 18 - 270 = 711th digit of the four-digit numbers on the list.\nSince each four-digit number uses 4 digits, the 711th digit is the third digit of the 178th four-digit number on the list.\nThe 178th four-digit number on the list is 1000 + 178 = 1178.\nThus, the last three digits Albert wrote are $\\boxed{178}$.", "Let's think step by step\nAlbert writes down the numbers from 1 to 9, then 10 to 19, then 100 to 199, then 1000 to 1999, and so on.\nEach of the numbers from 1 to 9 takes up one digit, so there are 9 digits in total.\nEach of the numbers from 10 to 19 takes up two digits, so there are 20 digits in total.\nEach of the numbers from 100 to 199 takes up three digits, so there are 300 digits in total.\nWhen Albert writes down the numbers from 1000 to 1999, he realizes that the list would contain an infinite number of elements.\nHowever, by this time, he has already written down 9 + 20 + 300 = 329 digits.\nSince the 1000th digit is the last digit of the 671st number, the last three digits he wrote are the last digit of the 670th number, the first digit of the 671st number, and the second digit of the 671st number.\nThe 671st number is 100 + 670 - 1 = 769, so the last three digits he wrote are $\\boxed{176}$.", "Let's think step by step\nWe see that the first 9 numbers have 1 digit, the next 90 numbers have 2 digits, and the next 900 numbers have 3 digits.\nThus, the 998th, 999th, and 1000th digits are the first three digits of the 189th number.\nThe 189th number is $10+189-10=189$, so the last three digits that Albert wrote are $\\boxed{189}$.\nThe answer is 189", "Let's think step by step\nThe first nine numbers have one digit, the next 90 have two digits, and the next 900 have three digits, so the first 999 digits include all of the one- and two-digit numbers.
