{"question": "Arnold is studying the prevalence of three health risk factors, denoted by A, B, and C, within a population of men. For each of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man in the population has only this risk factor (and none of the others) is 0.1. For any two of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man has exactly these two risk factors (but not the third) is 0.14. The probability that a randomly selected man has all three risk factors, given that he has A and B is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability that a man has none of the three risk factors given that he does not have risk factor A is $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.\n", "answer": "We first assume a population of $100$ to facilitate solving.
