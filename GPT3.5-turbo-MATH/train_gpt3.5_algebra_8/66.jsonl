{"question": "Problem:\nLuke wants to fence a square piece of land of at least 400 square feet. What should the side of the square be if he wants to use the least amount of fencing?", "answer": "The area of the land would be $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of the side. Since it has to be at least 400 square feet, we get $s^2\\geq 400$. Therefore, we get that $s \\le -20 \\text{ or } s \\ge 20$. Since the dimensions can't be negative, the least value of $s$ would be $\\boxed{20}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nLet $s$ be the side length of the square. Then the area of the square is $s^2$, so we want to find the smallest value of $s$ such that $s^2 \\geq 400$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $s \\geq 20$.
