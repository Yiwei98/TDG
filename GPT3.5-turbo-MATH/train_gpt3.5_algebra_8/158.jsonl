There are eight vertices on the cube, so we find that the sum 1001 is equal to $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def.$$ For any two faces adjacent at a vertex with $a$, the same two faces are adjacent to a vertex with $d$. Furthermore, any three adjacent faces must contain one of $a$ or $d$. Therefore, every term contains $a$ or $d$, and the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $d$. Considering the expression as a polynomial in $a$ (with the remaining variables fixed), we observe that $P(-d)=0$. Therefore, $a+d$ divides the given expression. Similarly, $b+e$ and $c+f$ divide the given expression as well. Therefore, $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def = k(a+d)(b+e)(c+f).$$ Here, since both sides are of degree three in their variables, $k$ must be a constant, which is easily seen to be $1$.\n\nIt follows that $(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.

Thus, Kate's sum is $200 + 300 + 400 + 500 + 600 + 700 + 800 + 900 + 1000 = 4500.$\n\nThe positive difference between their sums is $4500 - 5050 = \\boxed{550}.$", "Solution:\nJo's sum is $1+2+3+\\cdots+100=\\frac{100\\cdot101}{2}=5050$.\n\nKate rounds the first 100 positive integers to the nearest multiple of 10, and then adds them up.  The first ten positive integers round to 10, the next ten round to 20, and so forth, until the last ten positive integers round to 100.  So Kate's sum is $10\\cdot10+20\\cdot10+\\cdots+100\\cdot10$.  Factoring out a 10, we see that this sum is equal to $10\\cdot(1+2+\\cdots+10)+10\\cdot(1+2+\\cdots+10)+\\cdots+10\\cdot(1+2+\\cdots+10)=10\\cdot55\\cdot10=5500$.\n\nThe positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum is $5500-5050=\\boxed{450}$.", "Solution:\nJo's sum is $1+2+\\cdots+100=\\frac{100\\cdot101}{2}=5050.$\n\nFor Kate's sum, we round the first 100 positive integers to the nearest multiple of 10 to get the list: $10, 20, \\ldots, 100.$  The sum of these integers is $10+20+\\cdots+100=10(1+2+\\cdots+10)=550.$\n\nThe positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum is $5050-550=\\boxed{4500}.$", "Solution:\nJo's sum is $1+2+3+\\cdots+100=\\frac{100\\cdot101}{2}=5050$.\n\nKate rounds the first ten integers to $10$, the next ten to $30$, and so on.  Thus, Kate's sum is $10\\cdot10+20\\cdot30+30\\cdot40+\\cdots+100\\cdot100$.  Factoring $10$ out of each term, this is equal to $10(1\\cdot10+2\\cdot30+3\\cdot40+\\cdots+10\\cdot100)$.  Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, we can simplify this to $10(1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+10^2)+10(10+20+\\cdots+100)$.  The first term is equal to $385$, and the second term is equal to $550$, so Kate's sum is $10(385+550)=9400$.\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum is $9400-5050=\\boxed{4350}$.", "Solution:\nJo's sum is $\\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050.$\n\nKate rounds the numbers 1 through 100 to the nearest multiple of 10.
