In order for $y$ to be a positive integer, $100-5x$ must be divisible by 3. The largest multiple of 5 less than 100 is 95, which is not divisible by 3. The largest multiple of 5 less than 95 is 90, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, $x$ can be 18, 23, 28, ..., up to 90. We can then calculate the corresponding values of $y$ and $xy$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 18 & y &= 20 & xy &= 360 \\\\\nx &= 23 & y &= 17 & xy &= 391 \\\\\nx &= 28 & y &= 14 & xy &= 392 \\\\\nx &= 33 & y &= 11 & xy &= 363 \\\\\nx &= 38 & y &= 8 & xy &= 304 \\\\\nx &= 43 & y &= 5 & xy &= 215 \\\\\nx &= 48 & y &= 2 & xy &= 96 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of $xy$ is $\\boxed{392}$.", "Solution:\nWe can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ to obtain $y=\\frac{100-5x}{3}$. As $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $100-5x$ must be divisible by 3. We can easily find that the greatest multiple of 5 less than 100 that satisfies this is 95. Thus, we can set $5x=95$ to find that $x=19$, and then solve for $y$ to find that $y=5$. Thus, $xy=19\\cdot5=\\boxed{95}$.", "Solution:\nWe can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ to get $y=\\frac{100-5x}{3}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, we must have $100-5x$ divisible by 3. The largest such multiple of 5 less than 100 is 95, which gives $y=5$ and $x=1$. This gives $xy=\\boxed{5}$.", "Solution:\nWe can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ to get $y=\\frac{100-5x}{3}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, $100-5x$ must be divisible by $3$. The largest multiple of $3$ that is less than or equal to $100$ is $99$, which is equal to $3\\cdot 33$. Thus, $100-5x$ must be equal to $3\\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ such that $1\\leq k\\leq 33$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{100-3k}{5}$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, $100-3k$ must be divisible by $5$. The largest multiple of $5$ that is less than or equal to $100$ is $100$, which is equal to $5\\cdot 20$. Thus, $100-3k$ must be equal to $5\\cdot m$ for some integer $m$ such that $1\\leq m\\leq 20$. Solving for $k$, we get $k=33-\\frac{5m}{3}$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $5m$ must be divisible by $3$. The largest multiple of $5$ that is divisible by $3$ and less than or equal to $15$ is $15$, which is equal to $3\\cdot 5$. Thus, $5m$ must be equal to $3\\cdot n$ for some integer $n$ such that $1\\leq n\\leq 3$. Solving for $m$, we get $m=3-\\frac{n}{5}$. Since $m$ must be an integer, $n$ must be a multiple of $5$. Thus, the largest possible value of $n$ is $15$. Substituting this value of $n$ into the expression for $m$, we get $m=0$. Substituting this value of $m$ into the expression for $k$, we get $k=33$. Substituting this value of $k$ into the expression for $x$, we get $x=13$. Substituting the values of $x$ and $k$ into the expression for $y$, we get $y=19$. Thus, the greatest possible value of $xy$ is $13\\cdot 19=\\boxed{247}$.", "Solution:\nWe want to maximize $xy$, so we want to maximize both $x$ and $y$. The equation $5x+3y=100$ tells us that $5x$ is a multiple of $3$, so $x$ must be a multiple of $3$. The largest multiple of $3$ that is less than or equal to $100/5=20$ is $18$. If $x=18$, then $3y=100-5x=10$, so $y=10/3$, which is not an integer. Therefore, $x$ must be less than $18$. The largest multiple of $3$ that is less than or equal to $97$ is $96$, which gives $y=4$. The corresponding value of $x$ is $x=(100-3y)/5=(100-12)/5=76/5$. Since $76/5$ is not an integer, we try the next smallest value of $x$ that is a multiple of $3$, which is $x=15$. Then $3y=100-5x=25$, so $y=25/3$, which is not an integer. Therefore, we must have $x<15$. The largest multiple of $3$ that is less than or equal to $95$ is $93$, which gives $y=1$.
