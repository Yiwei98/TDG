Thus, if $a_n$ denotes the number of cans we have after starting with $n$ cans, we have the recursive formula $a_n=\\lfloor n/3\\rfloor+a_{n-\\lfloor n/3\\rfloor}$. We also know that $a_3=1$ (since we need three cans to make a new can). Using the recursive formula, we can compute $a_{243}$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\na_{243}&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{243-81}=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{162-54}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{108-36}=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{72-24}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{48-16}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{32}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{32-10}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{32}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{22-7}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{32}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{15-5}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{32}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3}\\right\\rfloor+a_{10-3}\\\\\n&=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{243}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{162}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{108}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{72}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{32}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{3}\\right\\rfloor\\\\\n&=81+54+36+24+16+10+7+5+3+1=\\boxed{237}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe can approach this problem recursively. Suppose we can make $n$ new cans from $m$ cans. Then, we can make $n$ more new cans from $n$ cans, for a total of $n + n = 2n$ new cans from $m$ cans. Thus, if we can make $n$ new cans from 3 cans, we can make $2n$ new cans from 6 cans, $4n$ new cans from 12 cans, and so on.\n\nSince three cans can be recycled to make a new can, it follows that we can make one new can from $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ cans. Thus, we can make $243/9 = 27$ new cans from the original 243 cans. From these 27 cans, we can make $27/3 = 9$ new cans, and from these 9 cans, we can make $9/3 = 3$ new cans. Thus, in total, we can make $27 + 9 + 3 = \\boxed{39}$ new cans, not including the original 243 cans."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Algebra"}
