Thus, $\\ell$ must divide $a$, so $\\ell$ is a factor of $k$.  Thus, the number of possible values of $a$ is equal to the number of ordered pairs $(k,\\ell)$ of relatively prime positive integers such that $k^2\\ell^2/d^2 \\le 50^2$, where $d = \\gcd(k^2,\\ell^2)$.  Since $d = 1$ if $k$ and $\\ell$ are relatively prime, we can drop the condition that $d$ divides $k\\ell$, and the number of possible values of $a$ is equal to the number of ordered pairs $(k,\\ell)$ of relatively prime positive integers such that $k\\ell \\le 50^2$ and $k$ is divisible by $\\ell$.  For each divisor $d$ of 50, there are $\\tau(d)$ possible pairs $(k,\\ell)$, where $\\tau(d)$ is the number of divisors of $d$.  The total number of possible pairs is thus $\\sum_{d|50} \\tau(d) \\sigma_0(d)$, where $\\sigma_0(d)$ is the number of divisors of $d$.  We can compute this as follows: \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{d|50} \\tau(d) \\sigma_0(d) &= \\tau(1) \\sigma_0(1) + \\tau(2) \\sigma_0(2) + \\tau(5) \\sigma_0(5) + \\tau(10) \\sigma_0(10) + \\tau(25) \\sigma_0(25) + \\tau(50) \\sigma_0(50) \\\\\n&= 1 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 3 + 6 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{85}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nLet $r$ and $s$ be the roots of the quadratic.
