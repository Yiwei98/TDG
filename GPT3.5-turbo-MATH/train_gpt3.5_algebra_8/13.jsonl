We wish to write $x^2-y^2$ as a difference of squares.  The only way to do this is to write $x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)$.  We can then set up a system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=51\\\\\nx-y&=1\n\\end{align*}Solving gives $x=26$ and $y=25$.  We can also set up the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=17\\\\\nx-y&=3\n\\end{align*}Solving gives $x=5$ and $y=2$.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ pairs of positive integers that satisfy the equation.", "Solution:\nFactoring the left side, we have $(x+y)(x-y)=51$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $x+y>x-y$, so we have two cases to consider: \\begin{align*}\n\\bullet\\quad x+y&=51\\\\\n\\quad x-y&=1\n\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}\n\\bullet\\quad x+y&=17\\\\\n\\quad x-y&=3.\n\\end{align*}Solving the first system gives $(x,y)=(26,25)$, and solving the second system gives $(x,y)=(10,7)$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-y^2=51$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Algebra"}
