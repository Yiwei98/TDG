This can be factored into $$(2a - 3)(b + 5) = 207$$We know that the prime factorization of $207 = 3^2 \\cdot 23$ and that both $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, so the only possible solutions $(a,b)$ are $$(a,b) = \\{(13,4),(6,18),(2,202),(3,64)\\}$$Out of these, only $(6,18)$ meets the requirement that $a+b=24$.
