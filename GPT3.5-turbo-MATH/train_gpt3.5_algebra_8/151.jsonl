{"question": "Problem:\nFor what values of $x$ is $2x^2+8x\\le-6$?

Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-3$, when $-3<x<-1$, and when $x>-1$. When $x<-3$, $(x+3)$ and $(x+1)$ are both negative, so the product is positive. When $-3<x<-1$, $(x+3)$ becomes positive, while $(x+1)$ remains negative - the product is negative. When $x>-1$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive.
