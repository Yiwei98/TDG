We find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$. For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$. One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero. Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero.

Since $y=mx+b$ passes through $(1,6)$, we have $6=m(1)+b$, or $m+b=6$.

We can do this by adding up the first odd integer, then the second, and so on, until we reach the last odd integer.  Alternatively, we can pair the first and last, second and second-to-last, and so on, and notice that each pair adds up to $300 + 500 = 800$.  Since there are $(500 - 300 + 1)/2 = 101$ odd integers between $300$ and $500$, the sum of all these integers is $101 \\cdot 800 = \\boxed{80800}$.", "Solution:\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of all the odd integers between $300$ and $500$ is equal to \\[(301 + 303 + \\cdots + 499) = \\frac{301 + 499}{2} \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{40000}.\\]", "Solution:\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the odd integers between 300 and 500 is equal to $(301+303+305+\\cdots+499)$. The common difference is $2$, so the number of terms is $\\frac{499-301}{2}+1=100$.
