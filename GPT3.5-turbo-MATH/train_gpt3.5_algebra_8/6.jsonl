If she uses up all her fencing material, how many feet is the largest side of the enclosure?", "answer": "Let's call the length of the rectangle $l$, and the width $w$. In general, the perimeter of a rectangle can be expressed as the sum of all four sides. Thus, it is equal to $2l+2w$. Similarly, we can express the area of the rectangle as $lw$. Since we know that Wendy uses all the fencing, the perimeter of the rectangle she encloses must be 180 feet. The area, which is 10 times that, comes out to 1800 feet. This gives us a system of two equations:  \\begin{align*} 2l+2w& =180\n\\\\lw& =1800. \\end{align*}If we solve for $l$ in terms of $w$ using the first equation, we find that $180-2w=2l$, or $l=90-w$. We can plug this expression back into the the second equation, giving us  \\begin{align*} (90-w)(w)& =1800\n\\\\ 90w-w^2& =1800\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad w^2-90w+1800& =0\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (w-60)(w-30)& =0 \\end{align*}Thus, the two possible values of $w$ are 60 feet and 30 feet. Since $l=90-w$, the possible values of $l$ must be 30 feet or 60 feet (respectively). Since the problem asks for the largest side, the answer is ultimately $\\boxed{60}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nLet the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$.  We have $2l+2w=180$, or $l+w=90$.  Also, we have $lw=10(2l+2w)$.  Expanding the right side gives $lw=20l+20w$.  Rearranging this equation, we get $w=\\frac{l^2}{20-l}$.  Substituting this into $l+w=90$ to eliminate $w$, we get $l+\\frac{l^2}{20-l}=90$.  Multiplying both sides by $20-l$ and simplifying gives the quadratic $l^2-90l+20l-1800=0$, which factors as $(l-60)(l-30)=0$.  Thus, $l=60$ or $l=30$.

Then the perimeter is $2l+2w$ and the area is $lw$. We have the equation $lw=10(2l+2w)$, or $lw=20l+20w$. Rearranging gives $lw-20l-20w=0$, which we can factor as $(l-20)(w-20)=400$. Since $l$ and $w$ must be positive (we can't have negative length or width), $l$ and $w$ must have the same sign. We can also see that $l\\neq w$, since otherwise we would have $(l-20)(w-20)=0$, which implies $l=20$ and $w=20$, but this doesn't satisfy the requirement that the area be ten times the perimeter. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that $l>w$, and we have $l-20=\\frac{400}{w-20}$. Since $l>w$, we want to maximize $l$, so we want to minimize $w-20$. The smallest factor pair of 400 with a difference of at least 0 is 20 and 20, which gives $l-20=20$, or $l=40$.
