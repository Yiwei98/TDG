In each group of red marbles, the first and last marbles in the group must be red.  (If $k=0$ or $k=1$, then there are no groups of green marbles or no groups of red marbles, and the requirement is vacuously satisfied.)\n\nSuppose we have a group of $m$ red marbles.  We can insert a green marble at the beginning and end of the row of red marbles to create $m+1$ groups of red marbles.  We can then insert the remaining 4 green marbles into these groups in such a way that the first and last groups are green.  This is a standard stars-and-bars problem; the number of ways to do this is $\\binom{m+3}{3}$.  Therefore, we have\n\\[N = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m+3}{3}.\\]Using the hockey stick identity, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nN &= \\binom{3}{3} + \\binom{4}{3} + \\binom{5}{3} + \\binom{6}{3} + \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\binom{4}{4} + \\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{6}{4} + \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\binom{5}{5} + \\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{7}{5} + \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\binom{6}{6} + \\binom{7}{6} + \\binom{8}{6} + \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\binom{1002}{1000}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\\binom{1002}{1000} \\equiv \\binom{2}{0} = \\boxed{1} \\pmod{1000}$.", "We first consider the case where the first marble is green. We can then build the sequence from left to right, and the number of green marbles will always be greater than or equal to the number of red marbles. We can build the sequence as follows: G, RG, RGG, GRGG, GGRGG, GRGRGG, GGRGRGG, GRGGRGG, GGRGGRGG, GRGGGRGG. The first few sequences have 1 green marble, the next few have 2 green marbles, and so on. The last sequence has 5 green marbles. Thus, the maximum number of red marbles we can have is $m=5+4+3+2+1=15$.\n\nTo count the number of ways to arrange the marbles, we can use a recursive approach. Let $a_n$ be the number of valid arrangements of $n$ marbles that end in a green marble, and let $b_n$ be the number of valid arrangements of $n$ marbles that end in a red marble. Then we have the recursive formulas $a_n=b_{n-1}$ and $b_n=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}$. The first formula comes from the fact that if we end in a green marble, the previous marble must be red, and the second formula comes from the fact that if we end in a red marble, the previous marble can be either green or red.\n\nUsing these formulas, we can build a table of values for $a_n$ and $b_n$ as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nn & a_n & b_n \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n4 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n5 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 11 & 11 \\\\\n8 & 21 & 22 \\\\\n9 & 43 & 43 \\\\\n10 & 85 & 86 \\\\\n11 & 171 & 171 \\\\\n12 & 341 & 342 \\\\\n13 & 683 & 683 \\\\\n14 & 1365 & 1366 \\\\\n15 & 2731 & 2731\n\\end{array}\n\\]Thus, the number of valid arrangements of $m+5=20$ marbles is $a_{20}+b_{20}=2731+2731=5462$, and the remainder when this is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{462}$.", "Let $r$ be the number of red marbles in the arrangement.  Then the number of green marbles whose right-hand neighbor is the same color as themselves is $g-1$ (where $g=5$ is the number of green marbles), and the number of red marbles whose right-hand neighbor is the same color as themselves is $r-1$.  Therefore, $g-1=r-1$, so $g=r$.  This means that every green marble is followed by a red marble, except for the last marble in the row, which is green.  Thus, the row ends with a green marble, and the other $m$ red marbles can be arranged in any way.  There are $m+1$ places to put this green marble, so $N=(m+1)\\bmod 1000$.  Since $m$ is the maximum number of red marbles that can be used, we construct the largest possible alternating string of green and red marbles, which gives $m=8$.  Therefore, $N=9$, and the answer is $\\boxed{009}$.", "We first notice that the pattern of the marbles must be of the form GGRGGRGGRG... or GRGRGRGRGR... because if there are three consecutive marbles of the same color, then two of them will be next to each other. Now, we do casework on the number of green marbles at the beginning of the pattern. If there are $0$ green marbles at the beginning, then the pattern will be GRGRGRGRG..., which means that there are $m+4$ marbles in the pattern. If there is $1$ green marble at the beginning, then the pattern will be GGRGGRGGRG..., which means that there are $m+6$ marbles in the pattern. If there are $2$ green marbles at the beginning, then the pattern will be GGRRRGGRG..., which means that there are $m+7$ marbles in the pattern. If there are $3$ green marbles at the beginning, then the pattern will be GGGRRRRGGG..., which means that there are $m+6$ marbles in the pattern. If there are $4$ green marbles at the beginning, then the pattern will be GGGGRRRRR..., which means that there are $m+5$ marbles in the pattern. Thus, we want to find the maximum $m$ such that $m+4$, $m+6$, $m+7$, $m+6$, and $m+5$ are all divisible by $2$. The maximum such $m$ is $m=17$, and there are $2^9=512$ ways to arrange the marbles, so the answer is $\\boxed{512}$.", "We can construct a valid string of marbles starting with GG or GR.  We claim that any valid string must start with one of these two substrings.  Indeed, suppose that the first marble is R.  Then the second marble must be G, and the third marble must be R, and so on, which is not valid.  Similarly, suppose that the first two marbles are GG.  Then the third marble must be R, and the fourth marble must be G, and so on, which is not valid.\n\nIf the string starts with GG, then the number of marbles whose right-hand neighbor is the same color is equal to the number of marbles whose right-hand neighbor is the other color if and only if the string of marbles after the GG is a valid string.  Similarly, if the string starts with GR, then the number of marbles whose right-hand neighbor is the same color is equal to the number of marbles whose right-hand neighbor is the other color if and only if the string of marbles after the GR is a valid string.\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of valid strings of length $n$ that start with GG, and let $g(n)$ be the number of valid strings of length $n$ that start with GR.  Then $f(2) = g(2) = 1$, and\n\\begin{align*}\nf(n) &= g(n - 1), \\\\\ng(n) &= f(n - 1) + g(n - 1).\n\\end{align*}Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\nf(7) &= g(6) = f(5) + g(5) = 2f(4) + 2f(5) = 6f(3) + 10f(4) + 4f(5) \\\\\n&= 22f(2) + 38f(3) + 10f(4) = 60,\n\\end{align*}and\n\\begin{align*}\ng(7) &= f(6) + g(6) = 2f(5) + 2f(6) + 2g(5) = 4f(4) + 6f(5) + 8f(6) + 4g(4) + 2g(5) \\\\\n&= 14f(3) + 30f(4) + 26f(5) + 12f(6) = 142.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the answer is $N \\equiv f(m + 5) + g(m + 5) \\equiv 60 + 142 \\equiv \\boxed{202} \\pmod{1000}.$", "Suppose there are $r$ red marbles. Then the number of pairs of adjacent marbles of the same color is $5+r-1$ (since there are $5$ pairs of adjacent green marbles, and then each red marble can be paired with one of the green marbles to its left). The number of pairs of adjacent marbles of different colors is $r\\cdot 5$ (since each red marble can be paired with any of the green marbles to its left). Since these two numbers are equal, we have $5+r-1=5r$, which gives $r=2$. An example of such an arrangement is GGRGGRG.\nNow we want to count the number of arrangements of $7$ green marbles and $2$ red marbles that satisfy the condition. There are $9$ spaces between or to the left or right of the green marbles. We must choose $2$ of these spaces to place the red marbles. This gives $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ ways to place the red marbles. Thus, $N=36$, and the answer is $\\boxed{036}$.", "Let $r$ be the number of red marbles used in the arrangement.  Note that the first marble must be green, and the last marble must be red.
