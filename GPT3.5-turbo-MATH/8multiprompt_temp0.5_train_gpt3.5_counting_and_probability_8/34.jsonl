We know that $a = 1$ and $b = 0$.  We want to find the probability that $a > b$, which is the same as finding the probability that $a - b > 0$.\n\nNote that $a - b = (a - c) + (c - d) + (d - e) + (e - f) + (f - g) + g$.  Each of the terms $a - c$, $c - d$, etc., is either 1 or $-1$, depending on whether team $A$ or the other team won.  Therefore, $a - b$ is the sum of seven terms, each of which is either 1 or $-1$.\n\nSince each game is independent and each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning, each of the seven terms is 1 or $-1$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that $a - b$ is positive is $\\frac{1}{2}$ by symmetry.  Therefore, the probability that $A$ finishes with more points than $B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{3}$.", "There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ games in total. After the first game, there are 20 games left and 10 points to distribute among the remaining 5 teams. By symmetry, the probability that team $A$ has more points than team $B$ is equal to the probability that team $B$ has more points than team $A.$ Therefore, the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is equal to the probability that they both have the same number of points.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that team $A$ and team $B$ both finish with $4.5$ points. Since there are $3$ games left for each team, the probability of each team winning those games is $\\frac{1}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{8}.$ Therefore, the probability that team $A$ and team $B$ both win all of their remaining games is $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64}.$\n\nNext, we count the number of ways that team $A$ and team $B$ can win their remaining games. Since there are $3$ games left for each team, there are $2^3 = 8$ possible outcomes for each team. However, we must exclude the outcome in which team $A$ wins all three remaining games and team $B$ loses all three remaining games, since this would result in team $A$ having more points than team $B.$ Therefore, there are $8 - 1 = 7$ possible outcomes for each team. It follows that there are $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ possible outcomes in which team $A$ and team $B$ have the same number of points.\n\nTherefore, the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $\\frac{49+p}{2^{20}},$ and we want to solve for $p.$ We know that $p = \\frac{1}{64},$ so the desired probability is $\\frac{49+\\frac{1}{64}}{2^{20}} = \\frac{3137}{2^{20}},$ and $m+n = \\boxed{3153}.$"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}

Conversely, any spacy subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ can be extended to a spacy subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}$ that does not contain $n$ by simply leaving out $n$ if it is not already in the subset.\n\nWe can then compute $b_{12}$ recursively as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nb_2 &= 1 \\\\\nb_3 &= 2 \\\\\nb_4 &= 3 \\\\\nb_5 &= 5 \\\\\nb_6 &= 8 \\\\\nb_7 &= 13 \\\\\nb_8 &= 21 \\\\\nb_9 &= 34 \\\\\nb_{10} &= 55 \\\\\nb_{11} &= 89 \\\\\nb_{12} &= 144.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the total number of spacy subsets of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,12\\}$ is $a_{12} + b_{12} = b_{11} + b_{12} = \\boxed{233}.$", "Solution:\nLet $a_n$ be the number of spacy subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ that contain $n.$  We can then count the number of spacy subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n + 1\\}$ that contain $n + 1$ in two cases.\n\nCase 1: The spacy subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n + 1\\}$ that contains $n + 1$ does not contain $n.$\n\nIn this case, this spacy subset must be a spacy subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n - 1\\},$ so there are $a_{n - 1}$ possibilities.\n\nCase 2: The spacy subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n + 1\\}$ that contains $n + 1$ contains $n.$\n\nIn this case, this spacy subset must exclude $n - 1,$ so it must be a spacy subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n - 2\\},$ which gives $a_{n - 2}$ possibilities.\n\nHence, $a_{n + 1} = a_n + a_{n - 2}.$  We can then compute $a_1 = 2,$ $a_2 = 3,$ $a_3 = 4,$ $a_4 = 6,$ $a_5 = 9,$ $a_6 = 13,$ $a_7 = 19,$ $a_8 = 28,$ $a_9 = 41,$ $a_{10} = 60,$ $a_{11} = 88,$ and $a_{12} = 129.$  Therefore, the total number of spacy subsets is $1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 13 + 19 + 28 + 41 + 60 + 88 + 129 = \\boxed{400}.$", "Solution:\nLet $a_n$ be the number of spacy subsets of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$.

We have $a_0=1$, and we want to find $a_{12}$.\n\nTo count the number of spacy subsets of size $n$, we need to consider the last element in the subset. If the last element is $n$, then the subset must contain either $n-2$ or $n-1$, but not both. If the last element is $n-1$, then the subset must contain $n-3$, but not $n-2$ or $n-1$.

Thus, there are $2^{k-1}$ ways to choose the remaining elements of the subset, since we can include or exclude each of the $k-1$ intervening elements between $n-k$ and $n-2k-1$. Therefore, the number of spacy subsets of size $n$ is $$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/3\\rfloor} 2^{k-1} = 2^0+2^1+\\cdots+2^3 = 8.$$To count the number of spacy subsets of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}$, we need to consider whether $n-2$ and $n-1$ are both in the subset or not.

If both are not in the subset, then the subset can contain any subset of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n-3\\}$ that is spacy. Otherwise, the subset can contain any spacy subset of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n-3\\}$ that does not contain $n-3$. Thus, we have the recursion $$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-4} + 8.$$Using this recursion, we can compute $a_{12}$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\na_0 &= 1, \\\\\na_1 &= 2, \\\\\na_2 &= 4, \\\\\na_3 &= 7, \\\\\na_4 &= 13, \\\\\na_5 &= 24, \\\\\na_6 &= 44, \\\\\na_7 &= 81, \\\\\na_8 &= 149, \\\\\na_9 &= 274, \\\\\na_{10} &= 504, \\\\\na_{11} &= 927, \\\\\na_{12} &= 1705.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, there are $\\boxed{1705}$ spacy subsets of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,12\\}$.", "Solution:\nWe can think of constructing a spacy set by selecting the integers that we want to include.
