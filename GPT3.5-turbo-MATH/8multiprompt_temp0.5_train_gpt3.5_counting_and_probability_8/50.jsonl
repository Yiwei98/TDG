Then the sum is equal to $1+1+1+1+1=5$. Now, we can obtain any other permutation by swapping two adjacent numbers, and it is easy to see that swapping two adjacent numbers $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ changes the sum by $2|a_i-a_{i+1}|$. Thus, the sum for any other permutation is equal to $5+2k$ for some integer $k$.
