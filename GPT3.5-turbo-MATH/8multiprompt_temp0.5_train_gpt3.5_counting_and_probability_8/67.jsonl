We can then use PIE to count the number of switches whose labels divide $2^k$, $3^k$, or $5^k$.\nThe number of switches whose labels divide $2^k$ is $10\\cdot 10\\cdot (k+1)$, since there are 10 choices for $y$ and 10 choices for $z$, and $x$ can take on $k+1$ values from 0 to $k$.

There are $10$ switches whose labels divide $2^k3^k5^k$. By PIE, the number of switches whose labels divide $2^k3^k5^k$ is $10^2-10-10-10+1=81$.
