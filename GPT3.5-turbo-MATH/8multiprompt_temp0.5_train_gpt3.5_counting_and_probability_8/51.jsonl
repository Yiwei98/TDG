If a grid is fixed by this symmetry, then every horizontal pair must be black-white or white-black (and similarly for vertical and diagonal pairs), so there are $2^{24}$ ways to color the horizontal pairs, $2^{24}$ ways to color the vertical pairs, and $2^{12}$ ways to color the diagonal pairs. Thus, $|Y_{180^\\circ}| = 2^{60}.$\n\nThe four reflections each fix $24$ horizontal and $24$ vertical pairs of squares. If a grid is fixed by a horizontal or vertical reflection, then every horizontal pair must be black-white or white-black (and similarly for vertical pairs), so there are $2^{24}$ ways to color the horizontal pairs and $2^{24}$ ways to color the vertical pairs.
