This limits $x$ to $5 \\le x < 6$ or $6 \\le x < 7$ or $13 \\le x < 14$ since, from the table above, those are the only values of $x$ for which $P(\\lfloor x \\rfloor)$ is an perfect square. However, in order for $\\sqrt{P(x)}$ to be rounded down to $P(\\lfloor x \\rfloor)$, $P(x)$ must be less than the next perfect square after $P(\\lfloor x \\rfloor)$ (for the said intervals).

The length of the interval $\\left[5,15\\right]$ is $10$, so the probability that $\\lfloor\\sqrt{P(x)}\\rfloor = \\sqrt{P(\\lfloor x\\rfloor)}$ is equal to $\\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{10}$.

So the range of $P(x)$ is $[-\\tfrac{45}4,\\infty)$.\n\nNext, we consider the interval in which $\\lfloor\\sqrt{P(x)}\\rfloor$ can possibly be defined. For $x \\geq 5$, we have $\\sqrt{P(x)} \\geq \\sqrt{P(5)} = 2$.

We split into cases based on the value of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 5$. We have $\\sqrt{P(\\lfloor x \\rfloor)} = \\sqrt{P(5)} = 2$, so we need $\\lfloor\\sqrt{P(x)}\\rfloor = 2$. This occurs when $2 \\leq \\sqrt{P(x)} < 3$, i.e. $-\\tfrac{45}4 \\leq P(x) < 9$. The solutions to this inequality are $5 \\leq x < \\tfrac{15}2$.\n\nCase 2: $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 6$.
