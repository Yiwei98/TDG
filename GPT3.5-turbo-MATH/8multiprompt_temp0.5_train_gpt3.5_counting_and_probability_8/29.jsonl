There are $4$ ways to place the first tile, $2$ ways to place the second, and $2$ ways to place the trio of green tiles. This gives a total of $4\\cdot 2\\cdot 2=16$ tilings for each arrangement of green tiles, for a total of $32$ tilings in this subcase.\nThis gives a total of $72$ tilings in this case.\nAdding up the cases, we have a total of $96+70+72=238$ tilings.

We can partition the set of all such tilings into three sets: those that end in a tile of color $A$, those that end in a tile of color $B$, and those that end in a tile of color $C$. If we remove the last tile from each of the tilings in the first set, we get a valid tiling of a $7\\times 1$ board with $n-1$ tiles, using colors $B$ and $C$. Similarly, the second set corresponds to tilings with colors $A$ and $C$, and the third set corresponds to tilings with colors $A$ and $B$.

Simplifying the expression gives $f(n) = 3\\cdot 2^{n-1} - 2f(n-1) - 2^{n-3}$, and we can compute $f(3) = 18$, $f(4) = 46$, $f(5) = 94$, $f(6) = 190$, and $f(7) = 382$.
