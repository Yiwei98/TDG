There are 2 ways to pick which team BD plays for first place, and there are 2 ways to pick whether AC plays A or C for third place.  This leaves only one team to play D for fourth place, so there is only 1 way to finish the tournament in this case.\n\nThus, there are $2+2=\\boxed{4}$ possible four-team ranking sequences."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
{"question": "Problem:\nFor a certain weekend, the weatherman predicts that it will rain with a $40\\%$ probability on Saturday and a $50\\%$ probability on Sunday. Assuming these probabilities are independent, what is the probability that it rains over the weekend (that is, on at least one of the days)? Express your answer as a percentage.", "answer": "The probability that it does not rain over the weekend is equal to the product of the probability it does not rain Saturday and the probability it does not rain Sunday, or $(1-.40)(1-.50)=.6\\cdot.5=.3=30\\%$.
