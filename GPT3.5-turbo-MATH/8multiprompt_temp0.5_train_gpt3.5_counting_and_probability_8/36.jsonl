But each such pair of integers in $S$ can exclude at most one other integer from $S$ (namely, the one that is $4$ or $7$ away from one of the integers in the pair), so $S$ can contain at most $285 + 13 = 298$ elements.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of elements in $S$ is $\\boxed{285}$.", "Solution:\nWe can divide the set $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,1989\\}$ into the residue classes modulo $7$:\n\\begin{align*}\nS_0 &= \\{7n\\}, \\\\\nS_1 &= \\{7n+1\\}, \\\\\nS_2 &= \\{7n+2\\}, \\\\\nS_3 &= \\{7n+3, 7n+7\\}, \\\\\nS_4 &= \\{7n+4, 7n+8\\}, \\\\\nS_5 &= \\{7n+5\\}, \\\\\nS_6 &= \\{7n+6\\}.\n\\end{align*}If we select any two numbers from $S_3,$ they differ by $7,$ so we can select at most one number from $S_3.$  Similarly, we can select at most one number from $S_4.$  Therefore, any subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,1989\\}$ that satisfies the given conditions can contain at most $286$ elements, as each of the other five residue classes contains $341$ elements.\n\nTo show that we can select $286$ elements, we can take all the elements in $S_0,$ $S_1,$ $S_2,$ $S_5,$ and $S_6,$ and then select one element from each of the pairs in $S_3$ and $S_4.$  Therefore, the largest number of elements $S$ can have is $\\boxed{286}.$"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
