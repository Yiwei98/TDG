Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?", "answer": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nLet $x$ be the number of daughters Bertha has who have no daughters, and let $y$ be the number of daughters Bertha has who have 6 daughters. Each of Bertha's daughters who have 6 daughters contributes 7 females to the total count, while each of Bertha's daughters who have no daughters contributes only 1 female to the total count. Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=6,\\\\\nx+7y&=30.\n\\end{align*}Solving this system gives $x=3$ and $y=3$, so Bertha has $\\boxed{6}$ daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.", "Solution:\nLet $x$ be the number of Bertha's daughters who have daughters, so $6-x$ is the number of her daughters who do not have daughters. Each of Bertha's daughters who have daughters has 6 daughters, so there are $6x$ granddaughters.  Altogether, Bertha has $6+6x$ daughters and granddaughters.  Since Bertha has no great-granddaughters, each of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters must either be one of the 6 daughters or be one of the $6x$ granddaughters.  That is, we must have $$6+6x=30.$$Solving this equation gives $x=4$.  Therefore, Bertha has $6-4=\\boxed{2}$ daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.", "Solution:\nLet $x$ be the number of Bertha's daughters who have no daughters, and let $y$ be the number of Bertha's daughters who have 6 daughters. Then, we have the equations $x+y=6$ and $6y=30$. Solving for $y$ gives $y=5$, and so $x=1$. Therefore, there is $1$ daughter with no daughters and $5$ daughters with $6$ daughters each.

Since $y$ is an integer, $x$ must be a divisor of 5. Thus, $x$ can be 1 or 5. If $x=1$, then $y=5$, and there are $1+5\\cdot 6=31$ daughters and granddaughters, which is not possible since there are only 30. Thus, we must have $x=5$, which gives $y=1$.

Each of the $6-x$ daughters who have 6 daughters contributes 7 females to the total of 30 females (herself, her 6 daughters, and her 6 granddaughters), so the $6-x$ daughters contribute $7(6-x)$ females to the total of 30 females. The $x$ daughters who have no daughters contribute only themselves to the total of 30 females.

The total number of daughters and granddaughters is $6+6x$, so we have the equation $6+6x+6x=30$, which gives us $x=2$. Therefore, there are $6-2=4$ of Bertha's daughters who have no daughters. Each of these daughters has no daughters of her own, so all 4 of them are included in the count of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.

Solving the system of equations yields $x=2$ and $y=3$. Therefore, Bertha has 2 daughters with no daughters, and $6\\cdot 3 = 18$ granddaughters, of which 3 have no daughters.

Since the problem asks for the number of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters, we want to find $x$. Each of Bertha's daughters who has 6 daughters contributes 7 to the total number of daughters and granddaughters, so the total number of daughters and granddaughters with no daughters is $30-7y$.
