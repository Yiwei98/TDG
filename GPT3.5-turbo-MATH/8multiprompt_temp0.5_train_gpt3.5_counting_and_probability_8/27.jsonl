This line passes through the points $(0,3)$ and $(3,0)$, and it divides the square into two triangles of equal area. One of these triangles, the one with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(1,1)$, is the region of points satisfying $x+y<3$. Therefore, the probability that $(x,y)$ lies in this region is equal to the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the square, which is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(1)(2)}{(2)(2)} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]", "Solution:\nThe line $x+y=3$ passes through the points $(0,3)$ and $(3,0),$ as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0));\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5));\ndraw((0,3)--(3,0),red);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"$x + y = 3$\", (1.5,1.5), red);\n[/asy]\n\nTherefore, the region where $x + y < 3$ is the shaded triangle, which has area $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}.$  The square has area $2 \\times 2 = 4,$ so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0));\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5));\ndraw((0,3)--(3,0),red);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"$x + y = 3$\", (1.5,1.5), red);\n[/asy]"], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
