{"question": "Problem:\nTwo different numbers are randomly selected from the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\\}$. The probability that their sum is 12 would be greater if the number $n$ had first been removed from set $S$. What is the value of $n$?", "answer": "All of the integers in the set $S$ have exactly one complementary number, $12-x$, such that their sum is 12, except for the number 6. Because $6+6= 12$, and the two numbers chosen are distinct, removing 6 will not eliminate any of the pairs that sum to 12, and it will reduce the total number of pairs possible. So $n=\\boxed{6}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nThe number of pairs of numbers that can be selected from the set $S$ is $\\binom{11}{2}=55$. If we remove $n$ from the set, the number of pairs of numbers that sum to 12 is the number of pairs of numbers that can be selected from the set $S$ that sum to 12, minus the number of pairs of numbers that sum to 12 that include $n$. Since $n$ is either one of the two numbers in a pair that sum to 12 or it is not, the number of pairs that sum to 12 that include $n$ is $2(n-1)$. Thus, the number of pairs of numbers that sum to 12 if $n$ is removed from the set is $\\binom{10}{2}-2(n-1)=44-2n$. The probability that two numbers selected from the set sum to 12 is $\\frac{6}{55}$, and the probability that two numbers selected from the set sum to 12 if $n$ is removed from the set is $\\frac{44-2n}{55}$. We are given that the second probability is greater, so we have \\[\\frac{44-2n}{55}>\\frac{6}{55}.\\]Solving for $n$ gives $n=\\boxed{17/2}$.

There are 11 choices for $n$, and if $n=1$ or $n=11$, there are 10 choices for the second number. If $n=2$ or $n=10$, there are 9 choices for the second number. For the other 7 values of $n$, there are 8 choices for the second number. Thus, the probability that the sum is 12 is greater if $n$ is either 2 or 10. We can check that these two values work, so the answer is $n = \\boxed{2,10}.$", "Solution:\nWithout loss of generality, let the two numbers selected be $a$ and $b,$ where $a < b.$  Then $a + b = 12$ if and only if $a$ is one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and $b$ is the corresponding number in $\\{11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6\\}.$  Thus, the probability of selecting two numbers with a sum of 12 is $\\frac{6}{\\binom{11}{2}} = \\frac{6}{55}.$\n\nSuppose $n$ is removed from the set.  Then the possible values of $a$ are $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\},$ unless $n$ is one of these values.
