There are 11 ways to choose the two digit number, and 9 ways to choose the one digit number, so there are $11 \\cdot 9$ ways to roll the dice in this case.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to roll the dice such that the number of dice showing a two digit number is equal to the number of dice showing a one digit number is $9^4 + 4 \\cdot 90 \\cdot 9^3 + 6 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 9^2 + 4 \\cdot 11^3 \\cdot 9 + 11 \\cdot 9 = 1,\\!401,\\!113,$ and the probability is $\\frac{1,\\!401,\\!113}{12^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{2921}{20736}}.$", "Solution:\nThere are $12^4$ possible outcomes, and we can count the number of successful outcomes by considering the number of dice that show a two-digit number. If $k$ dice show a two-digit number, then $4-k$ dice must show a one-digit number.  There are 3 two-digit numbers for each of the $k$ dice, and 9 one-digit numbers for each of the $4-k$ dice. Thus, the number of successful outcomes is \\[\\binom{4}{0}3^4\\cdot 9^0+\\binom{4}{1}3^3\\cdot 9^1+\\binom{4}{2}3^2\\cdot 9^2+\\binom{4}{3}3^1\\cdot 9^3+\\binom{4}{4}3^0\\cdot 9^4.\\]Therefore, the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{4}{0}3^4\\cdot 9^0+\\binom{4}{1}3^3\\cdot 9^1+\\binom{4}{2}3^2\\cdot 9^2+\\binom{4}{3}3^1\\cdot 9^3+\\binom{4}{4}3^0\\cdot 9^4}{12^4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1467}{531441}}.\\]", "Solution:\nThere are two cases to consider: either there are no two-digit numbers or there is one two-digit number. In the first case, there are 12 possible one-digit numbers and 3 dice that can show each one, so the probability of all four dice showing one-digit numbers is $\\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\right)^4=\\frac{81}{2^{12}}$. In the second case, there are $\\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose which die shows the two-digit number, 9 possible two-digit numbers, and 2 possibilities for the one-digit numbers. Thus, the probability of this case is $\\binom{4}{1}\\cdot 9\\cdot 2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\right)^3=\\frac{3^4}{2^{12}}$.
