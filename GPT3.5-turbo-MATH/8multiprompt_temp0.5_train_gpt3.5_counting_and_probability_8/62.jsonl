There are 8 toys. If Sam tries them one at a time, his probability of getting the $\\$1.75$ toy on the first try is $\\frac{1}{8}$. If he fails on the first try, his probability of getting it on the second try is $\\frac{1}{7}$, and so on. Therefore, the probability that he never gets the toy is \\[\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdots \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8},\\]so the probability that he has to get change is $1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
