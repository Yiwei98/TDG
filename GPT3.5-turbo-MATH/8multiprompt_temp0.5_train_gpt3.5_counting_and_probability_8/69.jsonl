The number of positive integers less than $510_{10}$ with $8$ ones in their binary representation is $\\binom{8}{1} + \\binom{8}{2} + \\dots + \\binom{8}{7} = 255$. Thus, the first $255$ numbers in $S$ are less than $510_{10}$, so $N$ is the $1000 - 255 = 745$th number in $S$ that is at least $510_{10}$.\n\nWe can now focus on finding the $745$th number in $S$ that is at least $510_{10}$. We can start by looking at the smallest possible $9$-digit number with $8$ ones in its binary representation, which is $100111111_2 = 447_{10}$. We know that the $255$th number in $S$ that is at least $510_{10}$ is $510_{10}$ itself, so we need to find the $490$th number in $S$ that is at least $447_{10}$. We can do this by listing out the numbers in $S$ in increasing order: \\begin{align*}\n& 100111111_2 = 447_{10} \\\\\n& 101011110_2 = 542_{10} \\\\\n& 101101110_2 = 598_{10} \\\\\n& 101110110_2 = 614_{10} \\\\\n& 101111010_2 = 626_{10} \\\\\n& \\dots\n\\end{align*}We can see that the $490$th number in $S$ that is at least $447_{10}$ is $447 + 490 - 1 = 936_{10} = 1110101000_2$. Therefore, $N = 1110101000_2$, and the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{100}$.", "We want the 1000th integer whose binary representation has 8 ones.  Since the first number in $S$ is $11111111_2 = 255$, the 1000th number in $S$ is $255+999=1254$.  Since $1254 \\equiv 254 \\pmod{1000}$, the answer is $\\boxed{254}$.", "Let $f(n)$ denote the number of ones in the binary representation of $n$. Notice that $f(n+1)$ is either $f(n)$ or $f(n)+1$. Since we are looking for the 1000th number in $S$, we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $f(n) = 8$ and there are exactly 999 $m<n$ such that $f(m) = 8$. Let $g(n)$ denote the number of positive integers less than $n$ with exactly 8 ones in its binary representation. Then we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $g(n) = 999$. Note that $g(256) = 255$, $g(512) = 510$, and $g(768) = 765$. Therefore, $N$ is in the range $768 < N \\le 1023$. Since $N$ has 8 ones in its binary representation, it is at least $2^7+2^6+\\cdots+2^0 = 2^8-1 = 255$ and at most $2^9-1 = 511$. Therefore, $N=\\boxed{269}$ or $N=\\boxed{781}$.", "Let $a_n$ be the $n$th number in $S$.

There are 15 positive integers less than or equal to 30 that are divisible by 2, 10 that are divisible by 3, and 6 that are divisible by 5.  However, we have counted some numbers twice: namely, those divisible by 6, 10, and 15.  There are 5 of these: 6, 12, 18, 20, and 30.  We must subtract them twice, since they have been counted twice.
