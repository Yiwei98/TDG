Therefore, the arrangement must be of the form $$S\\ G\\ S\\ G\\ S\\ G\\ S\\ G.$$If the second coin is silver, then the third coin can be either gold or silver. If the third coin is gold, then the fourth coin must be silver, the fifth coin must be gold, and so on. Therefore, the arrangement must be of the form $$S\\ S\\ G\\ S\\ G\\ S\\ G\\ S.$$If the third coin is silver, then the fourth coin must be gold, the fifth coin must be silver, and so on. Therefore, the arrangement must be of the form $$S\\ S\\ S\\ G\\ S\\ G\\ S\\ G.$$Thus, there are a total of $1+1+1=\\boxed{3}$ possible distinguishable arrangements.", "We can use complementary counting. The total number of arrangements is $8!$, since there are 8 coins and they are indistinguishable within their color. Now, we count the number of arrangements where at least two adjacent coins are face to face. We can do this by treating the two coins as one block and permuting the $7$ blocks (including the block of two coins). There are $2 \\cdot 7!$ ways to do this, since the two coins in the block can be either the gold or silver coins. However, we overcounted the arrangements where two blocks of two adjacent coins are face to face. There are $2 \\cdot 6!$ ways to do this, since there are two pairs of adjacent coins of the same color, and $6!$ ways to permute the remaining blocks. Thus, the number of arrangements where no two adjacent coins are face to face is $8! - 2 \\cdot 7! + 2 \\cdot 6! = \\boxed{4,\\!928}$.", "We will use complementary counting.  First, we count the number of arrangements with no restrictions.  There are 8 choices for the bottom coin, then 7 choices for the coin on top of that, then 6 choices for the coin on top of that, and so forth.  This gives $8!$ arrangements.\n\nNow, we count the number of arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent coins being face to face.  We can group each pair of adjacent coins into a block.  We have 8 blocks in all.  We need to choose 1 block to be the pair of adjacent coins that are face to face.  There are 8 choices for which block to choose.\n\nWe can then treat each block as a single object.  We have 7 objects in all.  We can arrange these objects in $7!$ ways.  However, we must multiply by 2 for each block, since we can flip each block over.  (This is because each coin has an engraving on one face but not the other.)  Therefore, there are $2^8 \\cdot 7!$ arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent coins being face to face.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements with no two adjacent coins being face to face is $$8! - 2^8 \\cdot 7! = 40320 - 2^8 \\cdot 5040 = \\boxed{20160}.$$", "Solution:\nBecause the coins are indistinguishable except for their color, we can think of the coins as being either gold or silver. Let's represent a gold coin by G and a silver coin by S. We want to find the number of arrangements of GGGGSSSS such that no two adjacent coins are S.\n\nConsider the number of arrangements of GGGGSSSS such that at least two S's are adjacent. We can count these arrangements by considering two cases:\n\nCase 1: Two S's are adjacent. We can choose the two adjacent positions for the S's in $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways. Then we can arrange the remaining 6 coins in $6!$ ways. Thus, there are $4 \\cdot 6!$ arrangements in this case.\n\nCase 2: Three or more S's are adjacent. We can count these arrangements by considering the number of adjacent S's. There are three adjacent S's in $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways, four adjacent S's in $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways, and five adjacent S's in $\\binom{1}{1} = 1$ way. For each of these cases, we can arrange the remaining 5 coins in $5!$ ways. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 5! + 2 \\cdot 5! + 1 \\cdot 5!$ arrangements in this case.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements of GGGGSSSS such that at least two S's are adjacent is $4 \\cdot 6! + 3 \\cdot 5! + 2 \\cdot 5! + 1 \\cdot 5! = 4 \\cdot 6! + 6 \\cdot 5!.$\n\nThe total number of possible arrangements of GGGGSSSS is $8!/(4! \\cdot 4!) = 70 \\cdot 70.$\n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements of GGGGSSSS such that no two adjacent coins are S is $70 \\cdot 70 - (4 \\cdot 6! + 6 \\cdot 5!)=\\boxed{38416}.$"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
