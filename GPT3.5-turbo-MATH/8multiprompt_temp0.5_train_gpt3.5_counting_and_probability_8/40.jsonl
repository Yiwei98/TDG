Now, we consider the possible permutations of each of these multiples of $11$. For example, the possible permutations of $110$ are $110$, $101$, and $011$. Note that each permutation will be a multiple of $11$. Thus, we need to find the number of permutations of each of these multiples of $11$. \nFor a three-digit number $abc$, the number of permutations is $3!=6$.

There are $9\\cdot 10\\cdot 10 = 900$ three-digit integers, and $9$ ways that the digits can be chosen so that the hundreds digit is zero.

{"question": "Problem:\nWhat is the probability that Fatima gets fewer heads than tails if she flips 10 coins?", "answer": "We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution. Since each coin flips heads or tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting fewer heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting fewer tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting fewer heads than tails, getting fewer tails than heads, or getting the same number of both. If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \\Rightarrow x=\\dfrac{1-y}{2}$. So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability. Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^{10}$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 10 coins.

To search for bad collections, we can start at an arbitrary right shoe (say $R_1$), check the left shoe it is paired with (say $L_i$), and from the previous observation, we know that $R_i$ must also be in the bad collection. Then we may check the left shoe paired with $R_i$, find its counterpart, check its left pair, find its counterpart, etc. until we have found $L_1$.
