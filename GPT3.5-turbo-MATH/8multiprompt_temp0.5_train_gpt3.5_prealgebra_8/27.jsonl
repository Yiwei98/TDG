We can do this by first counting the number of integers between $2$ and $130$ inclusive that are even, and then subtracting the number of integers between $2$ and $2$ inclusive that are even.  Since every other integer is even, the number of even integers between $2$ and $130$ inclusive is equal to the number of integers between $1$ and $65$ inclusive, which is $65$.
