Therefore, the sum of four consecutive primes is divisible by three.  The smallest such set of primes is $\\{ 2, 3, 5, 7 \\}$, and $2+3+5+7=\\boxed{17}$.", "Solution:\nThe only prime that is divisible by 3 is 3 itself, so if four consecutive primes have a sum that is divisible by 3, one of the primes must be 3. Thus, we are looking for four consecutive primes of the form $3,x,y,z$, where $x,y,z$ are distinct odd primes. The sum of these primes is $3+x+y+z$. Since $x,y,z$ are odd, they are not divisible by 2, so their sum is odd. The only way for an odd number to be divisible by 3 is if it is the sum of two numbers that differ by a multiple of 3. Since $x,y,z$ are distinct primes, they are all different modulo 3. Thus, one of them must be congruent to 1 modulo 3, and another must be congruent to 2 modulo 3. Without loss of generality, let $x$ be the prime that is congruent to 1 modulo 3, and let $z$ be the prime that is congruent to 2 modulo 3. Then $y$ must be congruent to 1 modulo 3, since $x,y,z$ are consecutive odd primes. The smallest such primes are $x=7$, $y=11$, $z=13$. Therefore, the sum of the four primes is $3+7+11+13=\\boxed{34}$.", "Solution:\nSince every prime number greater than 3 is either of the form $6k+1$ or $6k-1$, we can see that any four consecutive prime numbers must sum to a number of the form $12k$.

Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{36}$.", "Solution:\nThe only prime that is divisible by 3 is 3 itself. Therefore, the four primes must be of the form $3+n$, $3+(n+1)$, $3+(n+2)$, and $3+(n+3)$, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. The sum of these primes is $4\\cdot3+2+n+(n+1)+(n+2)+(n+3)=12+4n+6+4=4(n+9)$. This expression is divisible by 3 when $n+9$ is divisible by 3.
