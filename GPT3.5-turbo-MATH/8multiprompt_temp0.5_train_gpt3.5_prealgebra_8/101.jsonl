However, we can make the following observation: every number in the set can be written in the form $10n + 3,$ where $n$ is a nonnegative integer.  Moreover, if $n$ is even, then $10n + 3$ is divisible by 3, and hence is not prime.  Therefore, we only need to check the numbers in the set for odd values of $n.$\n\nWe can now list out the numbers in the set that are prime: $3, 13, 43, 53, 73, 83, 103, 113, \\ldots.$  There are $\\boxed{8}$ such numbers.", "Solution:\nAny prime greater than 3 can be written in the form $6n\\pm 1.$ Therefore, any difference of two primes greater than 3 can be written in the form $(6n+1)-(6m+1)=6(n-m).$ Thus, any such difference must be a multiple of 6. The only two numbers in the given set that are multiples of 6 are 30 and 72. Checking, $30=29+1$ and $72=71+1,$ so there are $\\boxed{2}$ numbers in the set that can be written as the difference of two primes.", "Solution:\nNote that every number in the given set is of the form $10n+3$ for some integer $n$.  We claim that every sufficiently large integer $n$ of this form can be written as the difference of two primes.  Indeed, suppose $n$ is an integer greater than $10$.  Then there exists a prime $p$ such that $n+5<p\\le 2n+2$.  (This is a consequence of the Bertrand postulate, which states that there is always a prime between $n$ and $2n$ for any integer $n\\ge 2$.)  Then $p-(n+3)$ is a difference of two primes, and $p-(n+3)=p-n-3-1=2p-2n-4\\ge 2(2n+2)-2n-4=2n-0>0$.  Thus, every sufficiently large integer of the form $10n+3$ can be written as the difference of two primes.\n\nIt remains to check the finitely many cases $n\\le 10$ by hand.  We find that the only numbers in the given set that cannot be written as the difference of two primes are $3$ and $33$.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{18}$ numbers in the given set that can be written as the difference of two primes."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Prealgebra"}
