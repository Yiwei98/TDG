{"question": "Problem:\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward, for example 313 or 1001. Ignoring the colon, how many different palindromes are possible on a 12-hour digital clock displaying only the hours and minutes? (Notice a zero may not be inserted before a time with a single-digit hour value. Therefore, 01:10 may not be used.)", "answer": "First, consider the three-digit palindromes.  There are $9$ choices for the first digit (the hour): $1$, $2$,..., $9$.  There are $6$ choices for the second digit (the tens digit of the minutes): $0$, $1$, ..., $5$.  The last digit (the units digit of the minutes) has to be the same as the first digit.  So there are $9 \\cdot 6 = 54$ three-digit palindromes.\n\nSecond, consider the four-digit palindromes.  The first digit (the tens digit of the hour) must be $1$.  There are $3$ choices for the second digit (the units digit of the hour): $0$, $1$, and $2$.  The third digit must be the same as the second digit, and the fourth digit must be the same as the first digit.

In this case, there are 6 choices for the first digit (since it can be anything from 1 to 9, or 0 if the second digit is also 0), and 5 choices for the second digit (since it cannot be the same as the first digit).

Since $3+5+3+8+0+8+8=35$, which is divisible by 5, the only possibility for $\\textrm{A}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.", "For a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit must be even.  For a number to be divisible by 5, its units digit must be 0 or 5.  For a number to be divisible by 10 (and hence by 2 and 5), its units digit must be 0.  So $\\textrm{A}$ must be 0.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.  For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  So $3+5+3+8+0+8+0=27$ must be divisible by 3 and by 9.  It is divisible by 9, so it is divisible by 3.  Therefore, $\\textrm{A}$ must be $\\boxed{0}$. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must be divisible by 4.  Since the last digit of our number is 0, we need the digit before that to be even.  The only even digit that works is 8, so our number is divisible by 4.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3.  We have already shown that the number is divisible by 2 and 3, so it is divisible by 6.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 8, the number formed by its last three digits must be divisible by 8.  Since the last digit is 0, we need the last two digits to form a number that is divisible by 8.  The only such number that works is 80, so our number is divisible by 8.", "For a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit must be even. For a number to be divisible by 5, its units digit must be 0 or 5. Thus $A$ must be 0. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus $3+5+3+8+0+8+0=27$, which is divisible by 9. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Thus $3+5+3+8+0+8+0=27$, which is divisible by 3. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3, which it is. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must be divisible by 4. Since $08$ is divisible by 4, $3538080$ is divisible by 4. \n\nFinally, for a number to be divisible by 8, the number formed by its last three digits must be divisible by 8. Since $080$ is divisible by 8, $3538080$ is divisible by 8. \n\nThus $\\textrm{A} = \\boxed{0}$.", "For $353808\\textrm{A}$ to be divisible by 2, $\\textrm{A}$ must be even. For it to be divisible by 3, we must have $$3+5+3+8+0+8+\\textrm{A}=27+\\textrm{A}$$ divisible by 3.  The only digit that makes this true is $\\textrm{A}=6$.  For it to be divisible by 4, the number formed by the last two digits, $8\\textrm{A}$, must be divisible by 4, so $\\textrm{A}$ must be 2.  For it to be divisible by 5, $\\textrm{A}$ must be 0 or 5, but since $\\textrm{A}$ is even, we must have $\\textrm{A}=\\boxed{0}$.  For it to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3, so we must have $\\textrm{A}=6$.  For it to be divisible by 8, the number formed by the last three digits, $08\\textrm{A}$, must be divisible by 8, so $\\textrm{A}$ must be 4.  Finally, for it to be divisible by 9, we must have $$3+5+3+8+0+8+\\textrm{A}=27+\\textrm{A}$$ divisible by 9.  The only digit that makes this true is $\\textrm{A}=0$.  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.", "A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the last two digits are divisible by 4. Thus, $\\textrm{A}$ must be even. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of $353808\\textrm{A}$ is $27+\\textrm{A}$, so $\\textrm{A}=3$ in order for the sum to be divisible by 3.\n\nA number is divisible by 8 if and only if the last three digits are divisible by 8. We know that $\\textrm{A}$ is even, so the last three digits are $8\\textrm{A}$. Since $8\\textrm{A}$ is divisible by 8 if and only if $\\textrm{A}=0$, we have $\\textrm{A}=0$.\n\nFinally, a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit is 0 or 5. Thus, $\\textrm{A}=\\boxed{0}$.", "A number is divisible by 2 if and only if the units digit is even. Thus $\\textrm{A}$ must be even.\n\nA number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of $353808\\textrm{A}$ is $27+\\textrm{A}$. Since $3\\mid 27$, we must have $3\\mid \\textrm{A}$.\n\nA number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last 2 digits is divisible by 4.
