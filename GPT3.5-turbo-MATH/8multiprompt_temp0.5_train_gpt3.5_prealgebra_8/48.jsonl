Therefore, we compute $8+6(3-8)^2 = 8 + 6(-5)^2 = 8 + 6(25) = \\boxed{158}$.", "Solution:\nRecall that exponents are evaluated before multiplication and division, and multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction.  Thus, we first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, then square it, then multiply by 6, and finally add 8.  We have \\begin{align*}\n8+6(3-8)^2&=8+6(-5)^2\\\\\n&=8+6(25)\\\\\n&=8+150\\\\\n&=\\boxed{158}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe have $8 + 6(3-8)^2 = 8 + 6(-5)^2 = 8 + 6(25) = \\boxed{158}$."], "level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra"}
