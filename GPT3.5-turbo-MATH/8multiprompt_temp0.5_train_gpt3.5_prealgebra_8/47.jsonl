The units digit of $54 - x$ is the same as the units digit of $4 - x.$  Therefore, we seek the number of $x$ such that the units digit of $x$ is the same as the units digit of $4 - x.$\n\nWe list the possibilities below:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 1 & 4 - x &= 3 \\\\\nx &= 2 & 4 - x &= 2 \\\\\nx &= 3 & 4 - x &= 5 \\\\\nx &= 4 & 4 - x &= 0 \\\\\nx &= 5 & 4 - x &= 9 \\\\\nx &= 6 & 4 - x &= 8 \\\\\nx &= 7 & 4 - x &= 7 \\\\\nx &= 8 & 4 - x &= 6 \\\\\nx &= 9 & 4 - x &= 9 \\\\\nx &= 0 & 4 - x &= 4\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the page numbers from 1 to 53 and their reverses match in $\\boxed{4}$ cases: 1 and 50, 2 and 40, 3 and 30, and 7 and 20.", "Solution:\nLet $x$ be the tens digit of a page number. If $x$ is odd, then the units digit of the page number is $3$. If $x$ is even, then the units digit of the page number is $7$. The only exception is page 50, which has a units digit of $0$.\n\nIf a page with tens digit $x$ has units digit $3$, then the corresponding page with tens digit $5 - x$ has units digit $7$. Conversely, if a page with tens digit $x$ has units digit $7$, then the corresponding page with tens digit $5 - x$ has units digit $3$.\n\nTherefore, the number of pages whose new and old page numbers share the same units digit is twice the number of pages whose tens digit is odd, plus 1 (for page 50).

Thus, there are no page numbers in this case that share the same units digit in the old and new page numbers.\n\nCase 2: The page number ends in a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nIn this case, the units digit of the reverse page number is the same as the units digit of the original page number.  For example, if the original page number ends in 3, then the reverse page number ends in 3 as well.\n\nThere are 5 possible units digits for the page number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).  For each of the digits 1 through 9, there are 5 page numbers ending in that digit (e.g. 1, 11, 21, 31, 41).  Thus, there are $5 \\cdot 9 = 45$ page numbers whose units digit is not 0.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{45}$ pages for which the units digit of the old page number and the new page number are the same.", "Solution:\nIf $n$ is a positive integer, then the units digit of $n$ is the same as the units digit of $n - 10k,$ where $k$ is a nonnegative integer.  (This is because subtracting 10k only affects the tens digit and everything to the left of it.)  Therefore, we want to find the number of pages $n$ such that $n$ and $54 - n$ have the same units digit.\n\nFirst, we look at the units digit of $n = 1.$  In this case, $54 - n = 53,$ so there are no pages with the same units digit.\n\nNext, we look at the units digit of $n = 2.$  In this case, $54 - n = 52,$ so there are two pages with the same units digit.\n\nNext, we look at the units digit of $n = 3.$  In this case, $54 - n = 51,$ so there are no pages with the same units digit.\n\nNext, we look at the units digit of $n = 4.$  In this case, $54 - n = 50,$ so there are four pages with the same units digit.\n\nNext, we look at the units digit of $n = 5.$  In this case, $54 - n = 49,$ so there are no pages with the same units digit.\n\nNext, we look at the units digit of $n = 6.$  In this case, $54 - n = 48,$ so there are six pages with the same units digit.\n\nWe can continue this pattern until $n = 9.$  In this case, $54 - n = 45,$ so there are eight pages with the same units digit.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages is $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = \\boxed{20}.$", "Solution:\nThe units digit of a page number only depends on the units digit of the page number's tens digit.  Thus, we need to count the number of page numbers whose units digit is the same as their tens digit.  These are 1, 2, 3, $\\dots,$ 9, 11, 22, $\\dots,$ 51.

Therefore, we want to count the number of page numbers such that $n$ and $54-n$ have the same units digit.
