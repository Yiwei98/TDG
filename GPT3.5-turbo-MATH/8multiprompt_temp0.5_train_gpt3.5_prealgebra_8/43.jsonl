{"question": "Problem:\nA school is arranging chairs in rows for an assembly. $11$ chairs make a complete row, and right now there are $110$ chairs total. The school wants to have as few empty seats as possible, but all rows of chairs must be complete. If $70$ students will attend the assembly, how many chairs should be removed?", "answer": "The original number of chairs is divisible by $11$, and the final number of remaining chairs must also be divisible by $11$ to have complete rows. This means that the number of chairs removed must be divisible by $11$ because the difference between two multiples of $b$ is also a multiple of $b$. In other words, $$b \\cdot m - b \\cdot n = b \\cdot k.$$ The smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $70$ is $77$, so we want $77$ chairs to remain.
