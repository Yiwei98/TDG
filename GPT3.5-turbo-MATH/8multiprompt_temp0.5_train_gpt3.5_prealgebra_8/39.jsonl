We want to count how many of these have an even number of red faces.  This is equivalent to counting the number of cubes that have 0 or 2 red faces.\n\nLet's look at a cube.  If the cube has 0 red faces, then it must be entirely in the interior of the block and not touching any of the faces.  To count the number of such cubes, we can imagine removing a $2\\times 2\\times 2$ cube from each corner of the original block, leaving a $2\\times 2\\times 2$ block of cubes in the center.  There are 8 cubes in the center, so there are $\\boxed{8}$ cubes with 0 red faces.\n\nIf a cube has 2 red faces, then it must be adjacent to one of the faces of the block.  There are 4 cubes along each edge of the block, and there are 12 edges, so there are $4\\cdot 12 = 48$ cubes adjacent to a face.  However, we have counted each corner cube twice, so we need to subtract off 8 to get the number of cubes with 2 red faces.  This gives us $48 - 8 = 40$ cubes with 2 red faces.  Therefore, there are $8 + 40 = 48$ cubes with an even number of red faces.", "The only cubes with an odd number of red faces are those on the corners of the block.\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm,4cm);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F,G,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r;\n\nA=(0.5,0.1);\nB=(0.5,0);\nC=(0,0.5);\nD=(1,0.5);\nE=C+(D-A);\nF=C+(B-A);\nG=D+(B-A);\n\ndraw(A--D--E--C--A--B--G--D);\ndraw(C--F--B);\n\na=(3/4)*F+(1/4)*B;\nb=(1/2)*F+(1/2)*B;\nc=(1/4)*F+(3/4)*B;\n\nm=(3/4)*C+(1/4)*A;\nn=(1/2)*C+(1/2)*A;\no=(1/4)*C+(3/4)*A;\n\nj=(3/4)*E+(1/4)*D;\nk=(1/2)*E+(1/2)*D;\nl=(1/4)*E+(3/4)*D;\n\ndraw(a--m--j);\ndraw(b--n--k);\ndraw(c--o--l);\n\nf=(3/4)*G+(1/4)*B;\ne=(1/2)*G+(1/2)*B;\nd=(1/4)*G+(3/4)*B;\n\nr=(3/4)*D+(1/4)*A;\nq=(1/2)*D+(1/2)*A;\np=(1/4)*D+(3/4)*A;\n\ni=(3/4)*E+(1/4)*C;\nh=(1/2)*E+(1/2)*C;\ng=(1/4)*E+(3/4)*C;\n\ndraw(d--p--g);\ndraw(e--q--h);\ndraw(f--r--i);\n\ndraw(a--b--c--f--e--d--a);\ndraw(b--k--j--c);\ndraw(d--l--o--g);\ndraw(e--h--n--p);\ndraw(f--i--r--k);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThere are 8 corner cubes, so there are $16-8=\\boxed{8}$ cubes with an even number of red faces.", "Solution:\nEach cube has six faces, and each face is either painted red or unpainted.  Thus, there are $2^6 = 64$ possible ways to paint the cube, and half of these, or $\\boxed{32},$ have an even number of red faces.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the cubes with an odd number of red faces.  There are 8 cubes with no red faces, and the other 8 cubes with no red face in the top layer have exactly one red face.  The remaining cubes have exactly two red faces.  Thus, there are $8+8+16 = 32$ cubes with an odd number of red faces, so there are $16$ cubes with an even number of red faces.", "Solution:\nEach of the 16 cubes has a red face on one side, so we need to determine which of the 16 cubes have an even number of additional red faces.  The cubes in the interior of the block have three red faces, those on the edges of the block have two red faces, and those on the corners of the block have one red face.  The eight corner cubes have a total of 8 red faces, while the six cubes on each of the 12 edges have a total of $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ red faces.  Thus, the total number of red faces is $8 + 12 \\cdot 12 = 152$, an even number.

Each of these cubes has two faces painted red and four faces unpainted.  Therefore, each of these cubes has an even number of red faces.\n\nFinally, consider the 6 interior cubes of the block.  Each of these cubes has no faces painted red, so it has an even number of red faces.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{12}$ cubes with an even number of red faces.", "Solution:\nEach cube has 3 faces painted red.  For a given cube, to have an even number of red faces, it must have either 0 or 2 faces painted red on the bottom.\n\nThere are 16 cubes, and the block is $4 \\times 4 \\times 1,$ so there are 4 cubes in each row, and 4 rows of cubes.\n\nThe bottom row of cubes has 4 cubes, and each cube has 2 faces painted red on the bottom, so there are $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ cubes with an even number of red faces.\n\nThe second row from the bottom has 4 cubes, and each cube has 0 faces painted red on the bottom, so there are 4 cubes with an even number of red faces.\n\nThe third row from the bottom has 4 cubes, and each cube has 2 faces painted red on the bottom, so there are $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ cubes with an even number of red faces.\n\nThe top row of cubes has 4 cubes, and each cube has 0 faces painted red on the bottom, so there are 4 cubes with an even number of red faces.\n\nThus, there are a total of $8 + 4 + 8 + 4 = \\boxed{24}$ cubes with an even number of red faces.", "Solution:\nThere are 8 cubes on the top layer of the block, and 4 of them have an even number of red faces, while 4 have an odd number.
