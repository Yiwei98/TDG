{"question": "Problem:\nHow many interior diagonals does an icosahedron have?  (An $\\emph{icosahedron}$ is a 3-dimensional figure with 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices, with 5 faces meeting at each vertex.  An $\\emph{interior}$ diagonal is a segment connecting two vertices which do not lie on a common face.)", "answer": "There are 12 vertices in the icosahedron, so from each vertex there are potentially 11 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 5 of these 11 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $12 \\times 6 = 72$ interior diagonals.
