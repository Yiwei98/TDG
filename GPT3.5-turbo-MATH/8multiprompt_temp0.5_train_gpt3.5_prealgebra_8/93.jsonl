First, we use Heron's formula to find that the area of the triangle with sides 15, 20, and 24 is $\\sqrt{29\\cdot 14\\cdot 9\\cdot 6}=6\\sqrt{406}$. Second, we use Heron's formula to find that the area of the triangle with sides 20, 20, and 27 is $\\sqrt{33\\cdot 13\\cdot 13\\cdot 7}=13\\sqrt{231}$. Finally, we can use the formula $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$ to find that the area of the triangle with sides 24, 27, and 20 is $24\\cdot 27\\cdot\\sin A=648\\sin A$, where $A$ is the angle opposite the side of length 20. We can use the Law of Cosines to find that $\\cos A=\\frac{4}{9}$, so $\\sin A=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2 A}=\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{9}$. Thus, the area of this triangle is $648\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{9}\\right)=72\\sqrt{65}$.\n\nAdding up the areas of the three triangles, we get $6\\sqrt{406}+13\\sqrt{231}+72\\sqrt{65}$.
