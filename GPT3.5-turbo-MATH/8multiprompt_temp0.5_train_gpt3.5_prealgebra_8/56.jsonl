{"question": "Problem:\nTwo 6-sided dice, one red and one green, are rolled.  What is the probability that the red die shows an odd number and the green die shows a number that is a perfect square?", "answer": "As per most two-die problems, the total number of outcomes is 36.  So now we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes.  There are 3 successful outcomes for the red die: it must show 1, 3, or 5.

Since the rollings of the two dice are independent events, to get to number of successful outcomes for both dice, we multiply the counts for each die, so the number of successful outcomes is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.

Since the distance from your house to your friend's house is half the distance from your house to the store, we know that it will take half the time, so $\\frac{t}{2}$. Then we can set up the proportion:\n\n$$\\frac{18}{2}=\\frac{t}{2}+\\frac{t}{2}+18$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{9}{2}=t+9$$\n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides gives $\\frac{9}{2}-9=-\\frac{9}{2}=-\\frac{18}{2}=-9$, so $t = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$ minutes.", "Solution:\nWe can use the fact that we know how long it takes to run a certain distance at a constant pace.  If we let $d$ be the distance we want to run, then the time it takes is proportional to $d$.  In other words, if it takes 18 minutes to run 2 miles, it will take $\\frac{18}{2}\\cdot d$ minutes to run $d$ miles.  Therefore, it will take $\\frac{18}{2}\\cdot 1=\\boxed{9}$ minutes to run 1 mile from my house to my friend's house.", "Solution:\nSince the distance from your house to your friend's house is half the distance from your house to the store, it will take you half as long to run there.
