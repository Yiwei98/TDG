Then we have $a^2+b^2=39^2=1521$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both integers, we can write $b = \\sqrt{1521-a^2}$. We see that $a$ must be less than 39, since otherwise $b$ would not be an integer. Since $39^2-36^2=27^2$, we try $a=36$ and find $b=15$. Thus, the length of the shorter leg is $\\boxed{15}$ units.", "Solution:\nLet the legs of the right triangle have lengths $a$ and $b$, so $a^2+b^2=39^2=1521$. We want to find the shorter leg, which we can assume is $a$. We know that $a^2 < a^2+b^2=1521$, so $a<39$. Checking the perfect squares below 1521 that are congruent to $1$ mod $4$, we see that $25^2=625$ and $33^2=1089$ are the only possible values of $a$. Of these, only $33$ is a factor of $1521$, so the length of the shorter leg is $\\boxed{33}$ units.", "Solution:\nLet the legs of the right triangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = 39^2 = 3^2 \\cdot 13^2$.  Since $a < b$, $a^2 < \\frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2) < b^2$, so $a^2$ and $b^2$ must be the squares of 2 consecutive integers.  Therefore, $a^2 = 13^2 - 5^2 = 144$ and $a = \\boxed{12}$.", "Solution:\nLet $x$ be the length of the shorter leg.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, the other leg has length $\\sqrt{39^2-x^2}$.  Since all three side lengths are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer, and therefore $\\sqrt{39^2-x^2}$ is an integer as well.  Thus, $39^2-x^2$ must be a perfect square.  We can factor $39^2$ as $3^2\\cdot 13^2$, so we want $(3\\cdot 13)^2-x^2$ to be a perfect square.  Factoring the difference of squares, we have $(39+x)(39-x)$ is a perfect square.  Since $39$ is not a perfect square, we must have $39+x$ and $39-x$ both perfect squares.  The only possibilities are $39+x=16^2$ and $39-x=9^2$, or $39+x=9^2$ and $39-x=16^2$.
