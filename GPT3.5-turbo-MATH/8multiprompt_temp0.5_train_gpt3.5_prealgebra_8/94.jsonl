Therefore, to obtain a multiple of $3$, the digit that is written must be either $1$ or $4$.  If we write a $1$, we get $7571$, whose digits sum to $20$, which is not a multiple of $3$.  If we write a $4$, we get $7574$, whose digits sum to $23$, which is a multiple of $3$.  Therefore, the only possibility is $\\boxed{4}$.", "Solution:\nWe know that the sum of the digits of $757$ is $7+5+7=19$, which is one more than a multiple of $3$. Therefore, if we add any digit to the right of $757$, the sum of the digits of the resulting number will be one more than a multiple of $3$. Hence, the resulting four-digit number will be divisible by $3$ if and only if the digit written to the right of $757$ is $\\boxed{2, 5, \\text{ or } 8}$."], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra"}
