Rearranging, $a(b-2008)=2008b$. Thus, $b$ must be a divisor of $2008$ plus $2008$ itself. The divisors of $2008$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008$, so the answer is $1+2+4+8+251+502+1004+2008=\\boxed{3780}$.", "If $x^2+bx+2008b$ factors, it must factor into the form $(x+a)(x+2008b/a)$, where $a$ is a divisor of 2008.  The sum of the roots is $-b$, so $-a-2008b/a = b$.  Multiplying both sides by $-a$ and solving for $b$ gives $b = \\frac{a^2}{2008-a}$.  Thus $a$ must be a perfect square factor of 2008.  The factors of 2008 are $2^3\\cdot 251$, so the perfect square factors are $1$, $4$, and $16$.  Thus we have three possible values of $a$, which give $b = 2008+1 = 2009$, $502$, and $64$, respectively.  The sum of these values of $b$ is $|2009+502+64|=\\boxed{2575}$.", "A quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ can be factored over the integers if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square, i.e. $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square.

Each factorization of $4016^2$ gives a unique factorization of $b$, and vice versa. Thus the sum of all possible values of $b$ is $\\pm 1$ times the sum of the factors of $4016^2$.

Since $1004^2$ is quite close to $(1000)^2=10^6$, we can guess that $1004^2+2\\cdot 1004+1=(1004+1)^2=1005^2$ is the next perfect square.  Thus, $k=1005-1004=1$ and $b-1004=\\pm 1004$.

Expanding this gives $x^2 + bx + 2008b = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn$. Since the coefficients of $x^2$ are equal, we have $m + n = b$. Plugging this into the expression for $(x + m)(x + n)$ gives $x^2 + bx + 2008b = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn = x^2 + bx + mn$, so $mn = 2008b$. Thus, $b$ must divide 2008.\n\nThe sum of all factors of 2008 is $(2^3 + 1)(100 + 1)(1 + 1) = 7 \\cdot 101 \\cdot 2 = 1414$. However, this includes negative factors as well as positive factors. There are $2^3 = 8$ positive factors of 2008, so the sum of all positive factors of 2008 is half of 1414, or 707.

Hence, $r$ and $s$ are both integers that multiply to $2008b$.\n\nSince $2008 = 2^3 \\cdot 251$, the prime factorization of $2008b$ is $2^3 \\cdot 251 \\cdot b$.
