Thus, the fraction simplifies to $$\\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3\\cdot4\\cdot2}=\\frac{9(10)}{3\\cdot4\\cdot2}=\\frac{90}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}.$$", "Solution:\nWe can factor the numerator and denominator separately: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3}&=\\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3^2(9+1)}{3(3+1)(3-1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3^2\\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3\\cdot 5}{2\\cdot 2}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe can factor a $3^2$ out of the numerator, and a $3$ out of the denominator, to get \\[\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3} = \\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)}.\\]We can then simplify $\\frac{3^2+1}{3^2-1}$ by factoring the numerator as $(3^2+1) = (3+1)(3-1) = 4\\cdot 2$ and the denominator as $(3^2-1) = (3+1)(3-1) = 4\\cdot 2$, so \\[\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3} = \\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)} = \\frac{3^2\\cdot 4\\cdot 2}{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 2} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\\]", "Solution:\nWe can factor the numerator and denominator, since they both have a factor of 3:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3} &= \\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3^2(9+1)}{3(8)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3^2 \\cdot 10}{3 \\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2^3 \\cdot 3} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe can factor the numerator and denominator as follows: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3} &= \\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3^2(9+1)}{3(8)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3^2\\cdot10}{3\\cdot8}\\\\\n&=\\frac{9\\cdot5}{3\\cdot4}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe can factor the numerator and denominator:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3} &= \\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{9(9+1)}{3(3+1)(3-1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{3 \\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe can factor the numerator and denominator using the difference of squares and the sum of squares, respectively: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3}&=\\frac{3^2(3^2+1)}{3(3^2-1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{9(9+1)}{3(3+1)(3-1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{9\\cdot10}{3\\cdot4}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}"], "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra"}
