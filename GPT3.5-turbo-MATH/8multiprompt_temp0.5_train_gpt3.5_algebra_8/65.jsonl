Therefore, the graphs intersect when $h(x-3) = h(x)$.  Substituting $x+3$ for $x$, we get $h(x) = h(x+3)$.\n\nLet $a$ be the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point.  Then $h(a) = h(a+3)$, or $h(a) = h((a+3)-3) = h(a+3)$.  Therefore, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection point are $h(a)$ and $h(a+3)$, and their sum is $h(a) + h(a+3) = 2h(a+3)$.  Thus, we need to find $a+3$.\n\nSince the graphs intersect at only one point, $h(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $(-\\infty,a)$ and increasing on the interval $(a,\\infty)$.  Therefore, $h'(x) < 0$ when $x < a$ and $h'(x) > 0$ when $x > a$.  Since $h(x)$ is a quadratic, $h'(x)$ is a linear function of $x$, so $h'(x)$ is always decreasing or always increasing.  Therefore, $h'(x) < 0$ for all $x < a$ or $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x < a$.\n\nSuppose $h'(x) < 0$ for all $x < a$.  Then $h(x)$ is decreasing on $(-\\infty,a]$, so $h(a+3) < h(a)$.

But $h(x)$ is also increasing on $[a,\\infty)$, so $h(a+3) < h(a)$.  This is another contradiction, so there is no solution.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that $h'(x) < 0$ for all $x < a$ is false, so $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x < a$.  This means $h(x)$ is increasing on $(-\\infty,a]$, so $h(a+3) > h(a)$.

Hence, $A$ is a multiple of 9.\n\nAlso, $A + B = 64 - C - D = 64 - 3c - 3d = 3(21 - c - d)$ is a multiple of 3.  Since $A$ and $B$ are both congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 9, $C$ and $D$ must be congruent to 0 modulo 3.\n\nThus, we can write $A = 9a,$ $B = 9b + 6,$ $C = 3c,$ and $D = 3d.$  Then $a + b + c + d = 5,$ and\n\\[ABCD = 9a \\cdot (9b + 6) \\cdot 3c \\cdot 3d = 81abcd \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, $ABCD$ is divisible by 100.  Furthermore,\n\\[ABCD = 81abcd \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\le (9 + 9 + 27 + 27)^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5 = 3456^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5,\\]so $ABCD$ is at most $3456^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5.$\n\nWe see that $A = 9,$ $B = 15,$ $C = 6,$ and $D = 12$ satisfies the conditions, and $9 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{9720}.$", "Solution:\nFrom $A+3 = B-3$, we have $B = A + 6.$  From $C \\times 3 = D \\div 3$, we have $CD = 9D.$  Hence,\n\\[A + (A + 6) + 3CD = 64.\\]Substituting $9D$ for $CD,$ we get $A + (A + 6) + 27D = 64,$ or $2A + 6 + 27D = 64.$  Hence, $2A + 27D = 58.$\n\nAlso, $B = A + 6$ and $C \\times 3 = D \\div 3,$ so $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ and $D$ are in the ratio $1:2:9:27.$  Hence,\n\\[A \\times B \\times C \\times D = (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 27)^2 = \\boxed{17496}.\\]", "Solution:\nWe have $A + B + C + D = 64,$ so $B = 64 - A - C - D.$  Then $B - 3 = A + 3,$ so $A = B - 6.$\n\nAlso, $C \\times 3 = A + 3,$ so $C = \\frac{A + 3}{3}.$  Finally, $D \\div 3 = A + 3,$ so $D = 3A + 9.$  Hence, we want to compute\n\\[A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot D = A(B - 6) \\cdot \\frac{A + 3}{3} \\cdot (3A + 9) = 3A^2 (A + 3) (B - 6).\\]Since $A + B + C + D = 64,$ $B = 64 - A - C - D = 64 - A - \\frac{A + 3}{3} - (3A + 9) = \\frac{140 - 11A}{3}.$  Hence,\n\\[A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot D = 3A^2 (A + 3) \\cdot \\frac{140 - 11A}{3} = -11A^4 + 119A^3 - 357A^2 + 420A.\\]We see that $A = 7$ is a root, and by synthetic division,\n\\[-11A^3 + 98A^2 - 161A + 60 = -11(A - 7)(A^2 - 3A + 5).\\]Since $A$ is positive, $A^2 - 3A + 5$ is always positive, so the only solution is $A = \\boxed{7}.$"], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Algebra"}
