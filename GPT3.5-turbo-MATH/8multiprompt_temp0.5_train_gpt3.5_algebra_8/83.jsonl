Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint.  To go from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ we run $3$ (left dashed red line) and rise $4$ (left dashed blue line), so our other endpoint has coordinates $(2+3,3+4)=\\boxed{(5,7)}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nLet $A = (-1,-1)$ and $B = (x,y)$ be the endpoints of the diameter.

The other endpoint of the diameter is thus on the line passing through $(-1,-1)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)$.  The slope of this line is $\\frac{1-(-1)}{\\frac{1}{2}-(-1)} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{4}{3}$.  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we find that the equation of this line is\n\\[y - (-1) = \\frac{4}{3}(x-(-1)),\\]which simplifies to $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{3}$.  Setting $y$ equal to 3 and solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 3 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{3}$.

Also, since $A$ and $B$ are endpoints of a diameter, the distance between them is equal to the diameter's length, which is the distance between $(2,3)$ and $(-1,-1)$.  Therefore, we have \\[(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 = (2-(-1))^2 + (3-(-1))^2,\\]which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 2y - 12 = 0$.

We can factor this as $(17y-9)(y+1) = 0$, so $y = \\frac{9}{17}$ or $y = -1$.  If $y = -1$, then $x-1 = \\frac{4}{5}(y+1) = 0$, so $x=1$.  This corresponds to the point $(1,-1)$, which is not the other endpoint of the diameter (since it is not on the circle).

Since the graph passes through the point $(0,1)$, the coefficient $a$ must be negative.  Thus, $a=-2$ and $f(1)=-2+b+1=-1$.
