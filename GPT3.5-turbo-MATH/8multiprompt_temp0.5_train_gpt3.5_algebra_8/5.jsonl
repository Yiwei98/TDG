Shifting this graph $a$ units to the right gives us $y=f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right)$.  For this graph to be identical to the original graph, we need $$f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right)$$for all $x$.  In particular, we need this to be true for $x=5a$, which gives us $$f(a) = f(0).$$Therefore, the smallest such $a$ is the smallest positive value of $a$ such that $f(a) = f(0)$.  Since we are not given any information about $f(x)$, we cannot determine this value of $a$ without further information.  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{unknown}}$.", "If the graph of $y=f(x)$ has the property that if it is shifted $20$ units to the right, then the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f(x)$, then $f(x)=f(x-20)$ for all $x$. We want to find the smallest positive $a$ such that $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}-a\\right)$ for all $x$. This is equivalent to $f(x)=f(x-5a)$ for all $x$. Since $f(x)=f(x-20)$ for all $x$, we have $f(x)=f(x-20n)$ for all $x$ and all integers $n$. Setting $n=4$, we have $f(x)=f(x-80)$ for all $x$. Setting $x=x-80$ gives $f(x+80)=f(x)$ for all $x$. Thus, we want the smallest positive $a$ such that $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}+16a\\right)$ for all $x$. This is equivalent to $f(x)=f(x+80a)$ for all $x$. Thus, we want $80a\\geqslant 20$ (so that $a$ is positive), which gives $a=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.", "Shifting a function $20$ units to the right is equivalent to replacing $x$ with $x-20$ in the formula for $f(x)$.  Thus, the condition that $f(x)=f(x-20)$ means that $f$ has a period of $20$.\n\nWe want to know the smallest $a>0$ such that $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}-a\\right)$.  This means that the period of $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$ is $\\frac{20}{5}=4$, and we want to find the smallest $a>0$ such that $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}-4a\\right)$.  This means that $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$ has a period of $4$, so $20$ (the period of $f$) is a multiple of $4$, namely $20=5\\cdot 4$.  Therefore, $a$ must be a divisor of $5$ and the smallest such $a$ is $a=\\boxed{1}$.", "Shifting $20$ units to the right is equivalent to replacing $x$ with $x-20$.  Thus, we have $f(x)=f(x-20)$.  Shifting $a$ units to the right is equivalent to replacing $x$ with $x-a$.  Thus, we want $f(x)=f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right)$.
