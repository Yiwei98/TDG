Substituting the first and second equations into the third equation, we get \\[3b=b+6.\\] Solving this equation gives $b=\\boxed{6}$, so Brenda is 6 years old.", "Solution:\nLet's start by using variables to represent the ages of the people in question. Let $a$ be Addison's age, $b$ be Brenda's age, and $j$ be Janet's age. We can use the given information to write three equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 3b \\\\\nj &= b + 6 \\\\\na &= j\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe third equation comes from the fact that Addison and Janet are twins, so they have the same age. We can use the first and third equations to eliminate $a$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= j \\\\\n3b &= j \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting $j = 3b$ into the equation $j = b + 6$, we get:\n\n$$3b = b + 6$$\n\nSolving for $b$, we find $b = \\boxed{2}$. Therefore, Brenda is 2 years old.", "Solution:\nLet $a$, $b$, and $j$ denote the current ages of Addison, Brenda, and Janet, respectively.
