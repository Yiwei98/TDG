Therefore, the 2 is $30^\\circ$ clockwise from the 12, so the hour hand is at $30^\\circ + 15^\\circ = 45^\\circ$.  The smaller angle between the hands is then $180^\\circ - (45^\\circ - 180^\\circ) = \\boxed{135^\\circ}$.", "Solution:\nAt 2:30 p.m., the hour hand is halfway between 2 and 3, and the minute hand is pointing at 6.  The minute hand is pointing at the 30-minute mark, which is $\\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2}$ of the way around the clock, so the minute hand has covered an angle of $360^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 180^\\circ.$\n\nThe hour hand is halfway between 2 and 3, so it has covered $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the way between the 2 and 3 hour marks.  Since there are 12 hour marks on the clock, each hour mark is $360^\\circ/12 = 30^\\circ$ from its neighbors.  Therefore, the hour hand has covered an angle of $30^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 15^\\circ$.\n\nThe smaller angle between the hour and minute hands is the angle between the hour and minute hands that is less than $180^\\circ$.  Therefore, we subtract the smaller angle from $180^\\circ$ to get the answer.  The angle between the hour and minute hands is $180^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{15^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = 7.5^\\circ$, so the degree measure of the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands is $180^\\circ - 7.5^\\circ = \\boxed{172.5^\\circ}.$"], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Prealgebra"}
