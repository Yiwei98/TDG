To make a two-topping pizza, we have 6 choices for the first topping and 5 choices for the second topping, but since the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, we have to divide by 2 to correct for overcounting. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{6 + 15 = 21}$ possible pizzas.", "Solution:\nFor one topping, there are $6$ choices. For two toppings, there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ choices. Thus, there are $6 + 15 = \\boxed{21}$ different one- and two-topping pizzas that can be ordered.", "Solution:\nFor one topping, there are 6 choices.
