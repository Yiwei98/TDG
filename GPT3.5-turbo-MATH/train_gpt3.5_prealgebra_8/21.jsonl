{"question": "Problem:\nJohn is thinking of a number. He gives the following 3 clues. ``My number has 125 as a factor. My number is a multiple of 30. My number is between 800 and 2000.'' What is John's number?", "answer": "Let $n$ be John's number. $n$ is a multiple of $125=5^3$ and of $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$, so the prime factorization of $n$ must contain 5 raised to at least the 3rd power, 2 raised to at least the 1st power, and 3 raised to at least the 1st power. Thus, $\\text{LCM}(125, 30)=2\\cdot3\\cdot5^3= 750$. $n$ is then some multiple of 750. Since $n$ is between 800 and 2000, $n=750$ is too small. Thus, we try $n=2 \\cdot 750=1500$. This number could be John's number. Notice that $n=3 \\cdot 750=2250$ is too large. Thus, John's number is $\\boxed{1500}$.", "generated_answer": ["The prime factorization of 125 is $5^3$. For a number to have 125 as a factor, it must be divisible by $5^3$ or 125. Since the number is a multiple of 30, it must be divisible by $2\\cdot3\\cdot5$ or 30. We seek the smallest multiple of 30 which is at least 800 and at most 2000 and is divisible by 125. We find that 750 is the largest multiple of 30 which is less than 800, and $750+3\\cdot125 = 1125$ is the smallest multiple of 30 which is at least 800 and is divisible by 125.

We also know that John's number is a multiple of $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Therefore, John's number must be divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, and $125$.

Since John's number has 125 as a factor, it must also have $5^2$ as a factor. Since John's number is a multiple of 30, it must have 2 and 3 as factors. Therefore, John's number can be written in the form $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot k$ for some integer $k$. We want to find the value of $k$ given that John's number is between 800 and 2000. We can write this as the inequality $800 \\leq 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot k \\leq 2000$, which simplifies to $4 \\leq 3k \\leq 16$. Therefore, $k$ must be either 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Since 125 is a factor of the number, the number must be at least $5^3 = 125$.\n\nSince the number is between 800 and 2000, it must be of the form $125 \\cdot k$, where $k$ is a multiple of 6 and lies between $800/125 = 6.4$ and $2000/125 = 16$.
