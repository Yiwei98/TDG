Therefore, the desired count is the number of integers between 15 and 180 that are not divisible by 4 or 7.  We can do this by considering the number of integers in the set $\\{15, 16, \\ldots, 179, 180\\}$ and subtracting the number of integers in this set that are divisible by 4 or 7.  There are $180/15 = 12$ integers in the set $\\{15, 30, \\ldots, 180\\}$, and $180/4 = 45$ integers in the set $\\{4, 8, \\ldots, 176, 180\\}$, and $180/7 = 25 + 5/7$ integers in the set $\\{7, 14, \\ldots, 175, 182\\}$.  However, we have overcounted the integers that are divisible by both 4 and 7, namely the integers in the set $\\{28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168\\}$.  Therefore, the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7 is $12 - 45 - 25 + 6 = \\boxed{-52}$.
