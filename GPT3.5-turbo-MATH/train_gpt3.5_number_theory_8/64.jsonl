We know that $n\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$, $n\\equiv2\\pmod{5}$, and $n\\equiv3\\pmod{7}$.\n\nFrom the first condition, we can write $n=4a+1$ for some positive integer $a$. Substituting this into the second condition, we have $4a+1\\equiv2\\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $a\\equiv3\\pmod{5}$. Thus, we can write $a=5b+3$ for some positive integer $b$. Substituting this into $n=4a+1$, we have $n=20b+13$. Substituting this into the third condition, we have $20b+13\\equiv3\\pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $b\\equiv5\\pmod{7}$. Thus, we can write $b=7c+5$ for some positive integer $c$. Substituting this into $n=20b+13$, we have $n=\\boxed{927}+140c$. Therefore, the smallest possible number of students in the class is $\\boxed{927}$.", "Solution:\nLet $n$ be the number of students in the class.
