Thus, there are no solutions with $\\tau(n) = 3$.\n\nIf $\\tau(n) = 2$, then $n$ is prime, and $\\tau(n+1) = 3$, so $n+1$ is a perfect square. Checking small primes, we find that $n = 2$ and $n=3$ are the only solutions in this case.\n\nIf $\\tau(n) = 1$, then $n = 1$, and $\\tau(n+1) = 6$, so $n+1$ has five divisors. Thus, $n+1$ is of the form $p^4$ or $p^2 q$ for primes $p$ and $q$. Checking small values of $p$, we find that $n=0$ and $n=3$ are the only solutions in this case.\n\nThus, the six least positive integers that are solutions to $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ are $n = 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11$, and their sum is $\\boxed{28}$.", "Solution:\nSince $\\tau(n)$ and $\\tau(n+1)$ differ by at most $1$, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $\\tau(n) = 3$ and $\\tau(n+1) = 4$.\n\nSince $n$ has $3$ divisors, it must be in the form $n = p^2$ or $n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. If $n = p^2$, then $n+1 = p^2+1$, which has $4$ divisors if and only if $p^2+1$ is a multiple of $4$. However, this is impossible since $p^2+1$ is always congruent to $1$ modulo $4$. Therefore, $n = pq$ for some primes $p$ and $q$. Since $n$ has $3$ divisors, one of $p$ and $q$ must be $2$. Without loss of generality, suppose $p=2$. Then $n = 2q$ and $n+1 = 2q+1$. Since $n+1$ has $4$ divisors, $2q+1$ must be a multiple of $4$, so $q$ is odd and congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. The smallest such prime is $3$, which gives $n=6$.\n\nCase 2: $\\tau(n) = \\tau(n+1) = 4$.\n\nSince $n$ and $n+1$ both have $4$ divisors, they must be in the form $n = p^3$ and $n+1 = q^3$ for some primes $p$ and $q$. Then $q^3 - p^3 = (q-p)(q^2+pq+p^2) = 1$. The only way this can happen is if $q-p=1$ and $q^2+pq+p^2=1$, which implies $q=p+1$ and $3p^2+3p+1=q^2 = (p+1)^2 = p^2+2p+1$. Solving the quadratic gives $p=0$ (which is not a prime) or $p=-1-\\frac{1}{3}$. This gives $n=0$ and $n=1$, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the six smallest solutions to $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ are $n=0,1,6,?,?,?$, where the remaining three solutions are in Case 1. The next smallest solution in Case 1 is $n=10$, which gives $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 4+4=8$, so the six solutions we seek are $0,1,6,10,15,21$. Their sum is $\\boxed{53}$.", "We first note that $\\tau(n) \\leq 2\\sqrt{n}$ for all $n.$ This is because if $d$ is a divisor of $n,$ then $\\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n,$ and $\\frac{n}{d} \\geq \\sqrt{n}.$ Thus, $\\tau(n)$ can have at most $2\\sqrt{n}$ divisors. Moreover, equality holds if and only if $n$ is a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, we have $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) \\leq 2\\sqrt{n} + 2\\sqrt{n+1} < 7$ for all $n \\leq 8.$ Checking each $n$ from $1$ to $8,$ we find that the only solutions to $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ are $n = 8$ and $n = 48.$\n\nWe claim that there are no other solutions.

In the first case, $n$ must be prime, and the only two consecutive primes are 2 and 3.

In the third case, we need to find a number $n$ such that $n$ is twice a prime, $n+1$ is a perfect square, and $n$ is not a multiple of 4. The first such number is 6.\n\nTherefore, the six least positive integers $n$ that are solutions to $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ are 2, 3, 6, 14, 42, and 86, and their sum is $\\boxed{153}$.", "Solution:\nSince $\\tau(n)$ counts the number of divisors of $n$, $\\tau(n) \\leq n$.
