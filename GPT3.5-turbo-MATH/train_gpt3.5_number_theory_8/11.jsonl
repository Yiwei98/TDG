Writing out the digits of $40305$, we see that the units digit is $5$.  Therefore, the units digit of $n$ must be $5$ in order to obtain a units digit of $0$ in the sum.  Writing out the digits of $n$, we have $n = 5000a + 500b + 50c + 5$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits.  Therefore, we have $$40305 + n = 5000a + 500b + 50c + 10 + 5.$$Since we want the sum to be a palindrome, the tens digit of $n$ must be 9, so $b=9$.  Therefore, we have $$40305 + n = 5000a + 450 + 50c + 15.$$Since we want the sum to be a palindrome, the thousands digit of $n$ must be 9, so $a=9$.  Therefore, we have $$40305 + n = 45000 + 450 + 50c + 15.$$This simplifies to $$n = 450 + 50c - 10 = 440 + 50c.$$The smallest value of $c$ which gives a palindrome is $c=1$, so the least natural number we can add to $40305$ to obtain a palindrome is $n = 440 + 50c = \\boxed{490}$.", "Solution:\nLet the number we are looking for be $x.$  We want to find the least $x$ such that $40,\\!305 + x$ is a palindrome.\n\nWe can write $40,\\!305 + x$ as $40,\\!000 + 300 + 5 + x.$  We want to choose $x$ so that this expression is a palindrome.  This means that $x$ must be the same as the number obtained by reversing the digits of $3 + x.$\n\nWe try small values of $x$ until we find one that works.  If $x = 1,$ then we want $4,\\!306$ to be a palindrome, which it is not.  If $x = 2,$ then we want $4,\\!307$ to be a palindrome, which it is not.  If $x = 3,$ then we want $4,\\!308$ to be a palindrome, which it is not.  If $x = 4,$ then we want $4,\\!309$ to be a palindrome, which it is not.\n\nIf $x = 5,$ then we want $4,\\!310$ to be a palindrome, which it is.  Therefore, the least such $x$ is $\\boxed{5}.$", "Solution:\nLet $N$ be the natural number we want to find, and let $P$ be the palindrome we want to create. Then $N+40305=P$, so $N=P-40305$. We want to find the least $N$ that is a palindrome. Thus we want to find the least $P$ such that $N=P-40305$ is a palindrome. \n\nWe see that $40305$ ends in $5$, so $P$ must end in $5$ if $N$ is to be a palindrome. Thus $P$ has the form $abc5cba$ for digits $a$, $b$, and $c$. We want to make $N$ as small as possible, so we want to make $a$ as small as possible. We cannot make $a=0$, since $P$ would not be a natural number. Thus $a=1$, so $P=105501$. Then $N=P-40305=105501-40305=\\boxed{652196}$.", "Solution:\nWe write the number we want to create as $\\underline{40,\\!305} + n = \\underline{40,\\!3ab}.$ Since the number is a palindrome, $a$ must be 5. Since we want the least such number, we want $b$ to be as small as possible. Therefore, we try $b = 4$ to get $\\underline{40,\\!345}$. Checking, we find that $40,\\!345 + 5,\\!043 = \\boxed{45,\\!388}$ is indeed a palindrome."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Number Theory"}
