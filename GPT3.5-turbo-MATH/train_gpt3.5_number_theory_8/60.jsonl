Multiplying both sides by $6^{20}$ and rearranging terms, we get $6^{20}x - 2x^2 - 2xy + 6^{20}y - 2y^2 = 0$.  We can rewrite this as $2y^2 + (2x - 6^{20})y - 6^{20}x = 0$.  Applying the quadratic formula, we get \\[y = \\frac{6^{20}-2x\\pm\\sqrt{(2x-6^{20})^2+8\\cdot6^{20}x}}{4}.\\]For $y$ to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.  We can rewrite the discriminant as $4(x+3\\cdot2^{18})(x-3\\cdot2^{18})$.  Thus, $x$ must be of the form $3\\cdot2^{18}+a$ for some nonnegative integer $a$.  Substituting this into the equation for the discriminant, we get $4(6\\cdot2^{18}+a)(a+2^{18})$.  For this to be a perfect square, both factors must be perfect squares.  Let $6\\cdot2^{18}+a = p^2$ and $a+2^{18}=q^2$.  Then $p^2-q^2=2^{18}(6-p^2)$.  Since $p^2\\equiv0,1\\pmod4$, we see that $6-p^2\\equiv2,3\\pmod4$.  Therefore, $2^{2+\\nu_2(6-p^2)}$ divides the right-hand side of the equation, so it must also divide the left-hand side.  Since $p^2-q^2=(p+q)(p-q)$ is odd, it follows that $p+q$ and $p-q$ are both odd, so $2+\\nu_2(p^2-q^2)=1+\\nu_2(p+q)+1+\\nu_2(p-q)=2+\\nu_2(p+q)$.  Therefore, $2^{2+\\nu_2(p+q)}$ divides the left-hand side of the equation, so it must also divide the right-hand side.  Since $p+q$ and $p-q$ are both odd, they are relatively prime, so $2+\\nu_2(p+q)+2+\\nu_2(p-q)=4+\\nu_2(p+q)(p-q)=4+\\nu_2(2^{18}+6p-2p^2)$ divides the left-hand side of the equation.  Since $2^{18}+6p-2p^2\\equiv2\\pmod4$, we have $4+\\nu_2(2^{18}+6p-2p^2)=3$.  Thus, we must have $3|p+q$ and $3|p-q$.  Let $p+q=3c$ and $p-q=3d$; then $p=\\frac{3c+3d}{2}$ and $q=\\frac{3c-3d}{2}$.  Substituting into $a+2^{18}=q^2$, we get $a+2^{18}=\\frac{9c^2-9d^2}{4}$.  Thus, $3|c^2-d^2$, so $c\\equiv d\\pmod3$ or $c\\equiv-d\\pmod3$.  We can assume without loss of generality that $c\\equiv d\\pmod3$.  Then $c=d+3k$ for some integer $k$.  Substituting $c=d+3k$ into $p+q=3c$, we get $p=3d+3k$ and $q=d-k$.  Substituting these into $6\\cdot2^{18}+a=p^2$, we get $6\\cdot2^{18}+a = (3d+3k)^2 + (d-k) = 10d^2 + 6dk + 4k^2$.  Thus, $2^{17}+3\\cdot2^{15}+k^2 = 5d^2 + 3dk$.  Rearranging, we get $k^2-3dk+2^{15}(5d-2^{2})=0$.  Applying the quadratic formula, we get $d=\\frac{3k\\pm\\sqrt{9k^2-4\\cdot2^{15}(5d-2^2)}}{10}$.  Since $d$ is an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.  Thus, we have $9k^2-4\\cdot2^{15}(5d-2^2) = m^2$ for some integer $m$.  Rearranging, we get $9k^2-m^2=4\\cdot2^{15}(5d-2^2)$.  As before, $2^{2+\\nu_2(5d-2^2)}$ divides the right-hand side of the equation, so it must also divide the left-hand side.  Also, $2^{2+\\nu_2(k^2-m^2)}$ divides the left-hand side of the equation, so it must also divide the right-hand side.  Thus, $2^{2+\\nu_2(5d-2^2)}$ divides $2^{2+\\nu_2(k^2-m^2)}$, so $\\nu_2(k^2-m^2)\\ge\\nu_2(5d-2^2)$.  Since $5d-2^2\\equiv1\\pmod4$, we have $\\nu_2(5d-2^2)=0$, so $\\nu_2(k^2-m^2)=0$.  Therefore, $k$ and $m$ have the same parity.  Substituting $m=2n-k$ for some integer $n$, we get $9k^2-(2n-k)^2=4\\cdot2^{15}(5d-2^2)$.  Rearranging, we get $35k^2-4n^2=4\\cdot2^{15}\\cdot31$.  Since $k$ and $n$ have the same parity, we can substitute $k=2a$ and $n=2b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.  Then $35a^2-2b^2=2^{14}\\cdot31$.  Since $35a^2\\equiv0,1,2\\pmod4$, we see that $2b^2\\equiv2\\pmod4$, so $b$ is odd.  We can substitute $b=2c+1$ for some integer $c$.  Then $35a^2-8c(2c+1)=2^{13}\\cdot31$.  Since $8c(2c+1)\\equiv0,4\\pmod8$, we see that $35a^2\\equiv7,3\\pmod8$, which is impossible.
