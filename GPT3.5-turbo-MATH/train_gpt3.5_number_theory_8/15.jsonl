The $12$ numbers that are multiples of $81$ reduce to multiples of $3$. We have to count these since it will reduce to a multiple of $3$ which we have removed from $999$, but, this cannot be removed since the numerator cannot cancel the $3$.There aren't any numbers which are multiples of $37^2$, so we can't get numerators which are multiples of $37$.

If $abc$ is divisible by 3, then $\\frac{abc}{999}$ can be simplified. Otherwise, $\\frac{abc}{999}$ is already in lowest terms. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ can be any digit from 1 to 9, the numbers $abc$ that are divisible by 3 are 123, 126, 129, $\\ldots$, 987.

We also know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, so $a$, $b$, and $c$ can each take on 9 possible values (since 0 is not allowed). Thus, there are $9^3=729$ possible values of $abc$.\n\nHowever, we need to eliminate the fractions that are not in lowest terms. The numerator $abc$ will not be relatively prime to 999 if $abc$ has a factor of 3 (since 999 is divisible by 3). There are 3 multiples of 3 between 0 and 999, so we need to subtract 3 from our count of possible numerators. Similarly, the numerator $abc$ will not be relatively prime to 37 if $abc$ has a factor of 37. There are 27 multiples of 37 between 0 and 999, but we have already counted the multiple of 111 (since 111 is divisible by 3), so we need to subtract 26 from our count of possible numerators.\n\nThus, the total number of possible numerators is $729-3-26=\\boxed{700}$.", "Let $x=0.\\overline{abc}$.

Also, $abc$ is divisible by 3, so $a+b+c$ is divisible by 3. $abc$ is also divisible by 37, so $37a+37b+c$ is divisible by 37. The possible values of $(a,b,c)$ are $(1,0,8),(1,1,7),\\ldots,(4,6,9)$. This gives 10 possible numerators: $108,117,126,\\ldots,469$. However, we can simplify some of these fractions.

These are $1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. Their product is $1\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot23$. To compute this product modulo 24, we group the factors into pairs that multiply to 1 modulo 24, namely $(1,23)$, $(5,19)$, $(7,17)$, and $(11,13)$. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 1\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot23 \\\\\n&\\equiv (1\\cdot23)(5\\cdot19)(7\\cdot17)(11\\cdot13) \\\\\n&\\equiv (-1)(-1)(-1)(-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}"], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
