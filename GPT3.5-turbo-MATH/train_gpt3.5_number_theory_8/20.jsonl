{"question": "Problem:\nThe prime factorization of 2007 is $3^{2}\\times223$. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy the equation $xy=2007$?", "answer": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair.

Since $xy = 3^a\\cdot 223^b$, we can think of this as placing two dividers among the $3$'s and $223$'s in $2007$ to separate them into two groups. For example, if we wanted to find the number of factors of $2007$, we would place no dividers among the prime factors, and if we wanted to find the number of factors of $3^2$, we would place one divider between the two $3$'s. Thus, the number of factors of $2007$ is the number of ways to place two dividers among the three numbers, which is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.
