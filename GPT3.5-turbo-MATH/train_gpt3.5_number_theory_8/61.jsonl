The last row has one entry, which is not divisible by 67.  The next row has two entries, each of which is the sum of the entry below and to the left and the entry below and to the right.  Thus, one of the entries is even, and the other is odd.  The odd entry is $\\frac{99+97}{2}=98$, which is not divisible by 67.  Thus, the even entry is divisible by 67 if and only if one of the entries below and to the left and the right is divisible by 67.  Since $67$ is prime, if an entry in the $n$th row is divisible by 67, then the two entries in the $(n+1)$th row immediately above it must be congruent to $0$ and $1$ in some order modulo $67$.  Thus, in the $n$th row, the entry that is diagonally above the even entry must be congruent to $1$ modulo $67$.  The entry diagonally above the odd entry is $\\frac{99+95}{2}=97$, which is not divisible by 67, so we can ignore it.  Thus, we just need to check whether the entries diagonally above the even entries in the $4$th row are congruent to $1$ modulo $67$.  The entries diagonally above the even entries in the $4$th row are $\\frac{95+91}{2}=93$ and $\\frac{93+89}{2}=91$.

Factoring powers of 2 out of each of these terms, we have \\[2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 16 = 2^8 \\cdot (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 8) = 2^8 \\cdot 8!.\\]Since $8!$ is not divisible by 5, it follows that the ones digit of the largest power of 2 that divides into $(2^4)!$ is the same as the ones digit of the largest power of 2 that divides into $2^8 = \\boxed{256}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
