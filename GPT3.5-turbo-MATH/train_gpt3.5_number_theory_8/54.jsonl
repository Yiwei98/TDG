Therefore, we can solve for $u$ to get\n\\[u = \\frac{10k-20}{k^2 - 100km - k + 2}.\\]Since $k$ and $m$ are positive integers, $k^2 - 100km - k + 2 \\ge k^2 - 100k - k + 2 = (k-50)^2 - 2498 > 0$, so $u$ is a positive integer.  Similarly, we can solve for $t$ to get\n\\[t = \\frac{10(k-1)}{k^2 - 100km - k + 2},\\]and $h$ is uniquely determined by $k$, $t$, and $u$.

Then the $2x+1$th stone we count is $n+2x$ if we are counting from left to right, and $n-2x$ if we are counting from right to left. Thus, if $99$ is counted, then either $99-n=2x+1$ or $99-n=-(2x+1)$. Since $99-n$ is odd, we must have $99-n=2x+1$, so $n=98-2x$.

Since $99$ is $3$ more than a multiple of $8$, we know that the number that is counted as $96$ must be a multiple of $8$, so it must be $8$ or $16$.  Since $96$ is $6$ less than a multiple of $9$, it must be $87$ or $99$.  If it is $87$, then the number that is counted as $89$ is $6$ more than a multiple of $8$, which is impossible.  Therefore, the number that is counted as $96$ is $16$ and the number that is counted as $98$ is $11$.  Since $11$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $8$, we know that the number that is counted as $9$ must be $8$ or $16$.  Since $9$ is $3$ less than a multiple of $9$, we know that the number that is counted as $17$ must be $18$ or $27$.  If it is $27$, then the number that is counted as $25$ is $6$ more than a multiple of $8$, which is impossible.  Therefore, the number that is counted as $17$ is $18$, so the number that is counted as $9$ is $16$.
