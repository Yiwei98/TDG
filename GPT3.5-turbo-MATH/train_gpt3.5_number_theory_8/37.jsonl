{"question": "Problem:\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x, y <m$.

Then $2b + 12 = 16$. Since $3,$ $5,$ and $6,$ are not factors of $16$, it is not true that these numbers must be divisors of $2b + 12.$\n\nIt only remains to check whether $1$, $2$, and $4$ must be divisors of $2b + 12$. The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \\cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$. Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$.

Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a+2$ must be a multiple of $3$. Checking each of the first six positive integers, we find that $a+2$ is a multiple of 3 for $a = 1, 4, 5, 6$. Thus, $a$ can be $-1, 2, 3, 4$, respectively, and the corresponding values of $b$ are $3, 5, 7, 9$, respectively. Checking each of these cases, we find that only $a=4$ works, which gives $b=9$.
