We have $f(n) = 3$ if and only if there exist three distinct ordered pairs $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, and $(a_3, b_3)$ such that $a_i^2 + b_i^2 = 2k$ for all $i$.\n\nNote that $a_i$ and $b_i$ must have the same parity, since the sum of two odd squares is even, and the sum of two even squares is even. Furthermore, we can assume that $a_i < b_i$, since $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are distinct.\n\nSuppose that $(a_1, b_1)$ and $(a_2, b_2)$ are two such ordered pairs. Then\n\\begin{align*}\n&a_1^2 + b_1^2 = a_2^2 + b_2^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad &a_1^2 - a_2^2 = b_2^2 - b_1^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\quad &(a_1 - a_2)(a_1 + a_2) = (b_2 - b_1)(b_2 + b_1).\n\\end{align*}Since $a_i < b_i$, we have $a_1 + a_2 < b_2 + b_1$, so $b_2 + b_1$ must divide $a_1 + a_2$. Similarly, $b_2 - b_1$ must divide $a_1 - a_2$. Therefore, we can write $a_1 + a_2 = m(b_2 + b_1)$ and $a_1 - a_2 = n(b_2 - b_1)$ for some positive integers $m$ and $n$.\n\nSolving for $a_1$ and $a_2$, we get\n\\[a_1 = \\frac{m+n}{2} b_2 + \\frac{m-n}{2} b_1, \\quad a_2 = \\frac{m-n}{2} b_2 + \\frac{m+n}{2} b_1.\\]Since $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers, we must have $m > n$. Also, $a_i < b_i$ implies that $m + n < 2(b_2 + b_1)$.\n\nTherefore, we can write\n\\[a_1 = b_2 + b_1 - c, \\quad a_2 = b_2 - b_1 + c,\\]where $c$ is a positive integer such that $c < b_1$ and $2c < b_2 + b_1$. (Note that $m$ and $n$ are uniquely determined by $b_1$ and $b_2$, and vice versa.)\n\nIt follows that $b_2 - b_1 = a_2 - a_1 = 2c - (b_2 + b_1 - 2c) = 4c - b_2 - b_1$. Hence, $b_2 + b_1 = 4c$. Since $2c < b_2 + b_1$, we have $c < \\frac{b_2 + b_1}{2} = 2c$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there is no such $n$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{none}}$.", "Solution:\nWe begin by listing out the values of $f(n)$ for some small values of $n:$\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(1) &= 1, \\\\\nf(2) &= 1, \\\\\nf(3) &= 2, \\\\\nf(4) &= 1, \\\\\nf(5) &= 2, \\\\\nf(6) &= 2, \\\\\nf(7) &= 4, \\\\\nf(8) &= 2, \\\\\nf(9) &= 3, \\\\\nf(10) &= 2.\n\\end{align*}We see that the smallest $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$ is $\\boxed{9}.$\n\nIndeed, the ordered pairs $(1, 2),$ $(2, 1),$ and $(3, 0)$ satisfy $1^2 + 2^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 = 5$ and $3^2 + 0^2 = 0^2 + 3^2 = 9.$", "Solution:\nWe can write $n$ as the sum of two squares in the form $n = a^2 + b^2,$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.

Thus, we can assume WLOG that $a\\le b$. If $a<b$, then $a^2+b^2<n$, so $a^2+b^2\\le n-1$. Thus, we only need to check $n$ up to $2\\cdot 100^2=20000$.\n\nWe now proceed by casework on $f(n)$:\nIf $n$ is odd, then $a^2+b^2$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ must be odd. Letting $a=1$ and $b=2$ gives a unique solution, so $f(n)\\le 1$ for all odd $n$.\nIf $n=2^k$ for some $k\\ge 2$, then $a$ and $b$ must both be powers of $2$. If $a=2^i$ and $b=2^j$, then $i<j$, and we have $2^{2i}(1+2^{2(j-i)})=2^k$. Thus, $2i=k$ and $1+2^{2(j-i)}$ is a power of $2$. The only power of $2$ that is one more than another power of $2$ is $2^1$, so $j-i=1$, which gives the solutions $(2^{k-1},2^k)$ and $(2^k,2^{k+1})$. Thus, $f(n)=2$ for all powers of $2$ greater than $2$.\nIf $n=pq$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$, then $a$ and $b$ must be either both divisible by $p$ or both divisible by $q$. Thus, we have two cases:\nCase 1: $a=px$ and $b=py$ for some $x$ and $y$. Then $p^2(x^2+y^2)=n$. Since $p^2$ and $x^2+y^2$ are both positive, we must have $x^2+y^2\\ge p$, so there are at most $p-1$ choices for $(x,y)$, which gives at most $p-1$ pairs $(a,b)$. Since $p\\neq 2$, this means that $f(n)\\le p-1$.\nCase 2: $a=qx$ and $b=qy$ for some $x$ and $y$. Then $q^2(x^2+y^2)=n$. If $q=2$, then we know that $x$ and $y$ must both be odd, so $x^2+y^2\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$. Since $q^2$ is divisible by $4$, this means that $x^2+y^2\\ge 2q$, so there are at most $q-1$ choices for $(x,y)$, which gives at most $q-1$ pairs $(a,b)$. If $q$ is odd, then we must have $x^2+y^2\\ge q$, so there are at most $q-1$ choices for $(x,y)$, which gives at most $q-1$ pairs $(a,b)$. Thus, $f(n)\\le q-1$.\n\nThus, for $f(n)=3$, we must have $n=2^k$ for some $k\\ge 2$. The smallest such $n$ is $n=\\boxed{16}$.", "Solution:\nFirst, note that $a$ and $b$ must be less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$, because otherwise, $a^2 + b^2$ would be greater than $n$. Now, suppose $n$ has three distinct ordered pairs $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, and $(a_3, b_3)$. Then, we have $a_1^2 + b_1^2 = a_2^2 + b_2^2 = a_3^2 + b_3^2 = n$. If we subtract two of these equations, we can see that $(a_1^2 - a_2^2) + (b_1^2 - b_2^2) = 0$, which means either $a_1 = a_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$, or $a_1 = b_2$ and $a_2 = b_1$. Therefore, the three ordered pairs must be of the form $(a, b)$, $(b, a)$, and $(c, c)$, where $a \\neq b$ and $a, b, c \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.
