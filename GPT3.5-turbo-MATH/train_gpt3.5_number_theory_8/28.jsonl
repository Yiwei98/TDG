Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$.

Since the sum of the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ is not equal to $2^4$, we have that $d_1 + d_2 + 16 \\neq 16$. Simplifying this inequality gives $d_1 + d_2 \\neq 0$.

We can check that $b=4$ does not work, since $4^6 = 16777216$ is greater than $14641$, but the base-4 digits of $11^4$ add up to $2^4=16$.
