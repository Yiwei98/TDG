{"question": "Problem:\nMady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?", "answer": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nAt the $n$th step, the leftmost $n$ boxes each contain a ball.  The $n+1$st box contains two balls, the $n+2$nd box contains three balls, and so on, until the $4n$th box contains $n$ balls.\n\nWe want to find the total number of balls in all the boxes after $2010$ steps, which is the same as the number of balls in the first $2010$ boxes.  We can find the smallest integer $n$ such that $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n > 2010$ by solving the inequality $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > 2010.$  This gives $n=63.$\n\nThus, the first $63$ boxes each contain $1$ ball, the $64$th box contains $2$ balls, the $65$th box contains $3$ balls, and so on, until the $252$nd box contains $63$ balls.

Then there are $m-1$ boxes to the left of the $m$th box, and the $m$th box itself contains 1 ball. The $m+1$st box contains 2 balls, the $m+2$nd box contains 3 balls, and so on, until the $m+n-1$th box contains $n$ balls. All the boxes to the right of the $m+n-1$st box are empty.\n\nThus, the total number of balls in the boxes is $1+2+\\cdots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, after 2010 steps, there are $\\frac{2010\\cdot 2011}{2}=\\boxed{2,\\!022,\\!155}$ balls in the boxes.", "Solution:\nWe can see that at the $n$th step, the first $k$ boxes are filled, where $k$ is the largest integer such that $1+2+\\cdots+k \\le n.$  In other words,\n\\[1 + 2 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\le n,\\]but\n\\[1 + 2 + \\dots + (k+1) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} > n.\\]Thus, $k$ satisfies $k^2 + k \\le 2n < (k+1)^2 + (k+1),$ so $k \\le \\sqrt{2n} - \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nIn particular, at the $2010$th step, the first $k$ boxes are filled, where $k$ is the largest integer such that $1+2+\\cdots+k \\le 2010.$  Solving $1+2+\\dots+k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\le 2010,$ we find $k=62.$\n\nThus, Mady fills the first $62$ boxes, and has $2010 - 1 - 2 - \\dots - 62 = 2010 - \\frac{62 \\cdot 63}{2} = 11$ balls left over.

After $2010$ steps, the $502$nd group of boxes is the last group that has had a ball placed in it.

It's easy to see that $\\gcd(b_n, b_{n+1}) = \\gcd(n^2+2n+101, (n+2)^2+100)$.
