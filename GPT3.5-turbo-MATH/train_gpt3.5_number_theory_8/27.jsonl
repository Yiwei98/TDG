The prime factorization of $10^{2010}$ is $2^{2010} \\cdot 5^{2010}$. Thus, the number of divisors of $10^{2010}$ is $(2010+1)^2 = 40401$. Thus, $f(2010)$ has $\\boxed{40401}$ positive integer divisors.", "Solution:\nThe decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{k}$ has $n$ digits after the decimal point if and only if $\\frac{10^n}{k}$ is an integer, but $\\frac{10^{n-1}}{k}$ is not an integer.  Thus $k$ must divide $10^n$ but not $10^{n-1}$.  Therefore, $k$ is of the form $2^a 5^b$ where $a+b=n$ and $a \\leq n-1$, $b \\leq n-1$.  Conversely, any such $k$ works, so $f(n)$ is the smallest number of the form $2^a 5^b$ where $a+b=n$ and $a \\leq n-1$, $b \\leq n-1$.\n\nWe have $f(2010) = 2^{1005} 5^{1005}$, so the number of positive integer divisors of $f(2010)$ is $(1005+1)(1005+1) = \\boxed{1,\\!022,\\!404}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
