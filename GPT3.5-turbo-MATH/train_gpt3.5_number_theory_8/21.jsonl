Consider the polynomial $f(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^{99})^4$. The coefficient of $x^{201}$ in this polynomial is the number of solutions to the equation. We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to write $f(x) = \\left(\\frac{1 - x^{100}}{1 - x}\\right)^4$. Expanding this out using the binomial theorem, we get that the coefficient of $x^{201}$ is equal to\n\\[\\binom{3}{3} \\binom{300}{1} - \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{200}{1} + \\binom{3}{1} \\binom{100}{1} - \\binom{3}{0} \\binom{0}{1} = 45000 - 3000 + 300 - 0 = \\boxed{42000}.\\]", "We can write $a_i = 100b_i + c_i$, where $0 \\le b_i, c_i \\le 99$.
