We know that 9 in base 10 is 10 in base 9.  We need to count the number of factors of 10 in $10!$ in base 9.  We can count the number of factors of 5 in 10!, which will give us the number of factors of 10.  There are two factors of 5 in 10!, so there is $\\boxed{1}$ factor of 10 in base 9.", "We want to find the number of factors of 9 in $10!$ when it is written in base 9.  Since 9 is a factor of 10, there are more factors of 3 than factors of 9 in $10!$.  We can count the factors of 3 by repeatedly dividing by 3 and counting the quotient until we get to 0.  We get the following:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n10 & \\\\\n3 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]Thus, $10!$ has $\\boxed{4}$ zeroes when written in base 9.", "Solution:\nIn base 9, the prime factorization of 10! is $2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1$. Each factor of 2 and 5 contributes a factor of 10 to the end of the number, so we need to count the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 10!. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we just need to count the number of factors of 5. There is one factor of 5 in the prime factorization of 10!, so 10! ends in $\\boxed{1}$ zero when written in base 9.", "We want to find the largest power of 9 that divides $10!$ in base 9. Since $10! = 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, we count the number of factors of 3 and 9 in $10!$, which will be the same as the number of factors of 9 in $10!$ in base 9. We see that there are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 3$ factors of 3, and $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 1$ factor of 9. Therefore, $10!$ in base 9 is divisible by $9^1 \\cdot 3^3$, or $3^3 \\cdot 10$ in base 10. This means that $10!$ ends in $\\boxed{3}$ zeroes when written in base 9.", "We need to find the highest power of 9 that divides $10!$. Since $10!$ has more factors of 2 than of 3, we only need to count the number of factors of 3 in $10!$. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 3$ factors of 3 in $10!$, and $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 1$ factor of 9 in $10!$. Therefore, $10!$ has $3 + 1 = \\boxed{4}$ zeroes when written in base 9.", "We know that $10!$ is divisible by $10$, so it has at least one factor of $2$ and one factor of $5$.  Since $9$ is not a factor of $10!$, it follows that $10!$ has only one factor of $3$.  Therefore, $10!$ has one trailing zero when written in base $9$.  (In base $10$, $10!$ has two trailing zeroes.)  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Number Theory"}
