The largest factor of $24$ that is greater than $2$ is $8$. Letting $k=8$, we get $24=8m(x+2)^2$, or $3=m(x+2)^2$.

Thus, $b^{\\frac{4}{5}} - d^{\\frac{2}{3}} = -19$. We can now find a common denominator: $$b^{\\frac{4}{5}} - d^{\\frac{2}{3}} = -19\\cdot\\frac{3\\cdot5}{3\\cdot5}.$$Simplifying the left side and cubing both sides, we get $$(b^3)^{\\frac{4}{5}} = (d^2)^{\\frac{2}{3}} - 19^3\\cdot 3\\cdot 5.$$Since $a^5 = b^4$, we know that $b$ is a perfect fifth power. Let $b = e^5$. Then $e^4 = a$, and $(e^5)^3 = (e^3)^2\\cdot e^3 = c^3 = d^2$. Therefore, $d$ is a perfect cube. Let $d = f^3$. Then $c = f^2$, and $b^{\\frac{4}{5}} - d^{\\frac{2}{3}} = e^4 - f^2 = -19\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 19$. We can factor the left side as a difference of squares: $$(e^2 + f)(e^2 - f) = -19\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 19.$$Since $e$ and $f$ are integers, $e^2 + f$ and $e^2 - f$ must have the same parity. Therefore, $e^2 + f$ and $e^2 - f$ are both even or both odd. Since their product is odd, they are both odd. Then $2e^2$ is greater than $2f$, so $$2e^2 + 2f = e^2 + f + e^2 - f + 2f = 2(e^2 + f) = 19\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 19.$$Thus, $e^2 + f = 19\\cdot 3\\cdot 19$, so $e^2 = 19\\cdot 2\\cdot 19 - f$. Since $e^2$ is even, $f$ must be odd. Therefore, $f^3 = d$ is odd, so $d^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ is also odd. Then $b^{\\frac{4}{5}}$ is even, so $b$ is even. Thus, $d - b$ is odd. We have $e^4 - f^2 = -19\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 19$, so $(e^2 + f)(e^2 - f) = -19\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 19$. Since $e^2 + f$ is odd and $e^2 - f$ is even, $e^2 + f = 19\\cdot 19\\cdot 3$ and $e^2 - f = 5\\cdot 3$. Therefore, $e^2 = 361$ and $f = 8$. Then $d - b = f^3 - e^5 = 8^3 - 19^2 = \\boxed{375}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
