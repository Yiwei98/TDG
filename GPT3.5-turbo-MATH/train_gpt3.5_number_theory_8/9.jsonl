We consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: $a$ is odd.  Then $a+1$ is even, so $(a+1)/2$ is an integer.  Thus, $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both odd, so $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is also odd and cannot be a multiple of $5$.\n\nCase 2: $a$ is even.  Then $a+1$ is odd, so $(a+1)/2$ is not an integer.  We can write\n\\begin{align*}\nd_1 \\cdot d_2 &= (a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2})(a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}) \\\\\n&= (a^2 + 2^a)^2 - (a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2})^2 \\\\\n&= a^4 + 2 \\cdot 2^{2a} + 2a^2 \\cdot 2^a - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1} \\\\\n&= a^4 + 2a^2 \\cdot 2^a + 2^{2a} - a^2 \\cdot 2^a \\\\\n&= a^2 (a^2 - 2^a) + 2^{2a} + 2^{2a - 2} \\\\\n&= a^2 (a - 2^{a/2})(a + 2^{a/2}) + 5 \\cdot 2^{2a - 2}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$ if and only if $a^2 (a - 2^{a/2})(a + 2^{a/2})$ is a multiple of $5$.  Since $5$ is prime, this is true if and only if one of $a$, $a - 2^{a/2}$, and $a + 2^{a/2}$ is a multiple of $5$.\n\nWe can easily check that $a = 1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$ do not work.  For $a \\ge 6$, note that $2^{a/2}$ grows much faster than $a$, so if $a$ is not a multiple of $5$, then $a - 2^{a/2}$ and $a + 2^{a/2}$ are also not multiples of $5$.  Thus, we only need to check the values of $a$ that are multiples of $5$.  We find that $a = 10, 15, 20, \\ldots, 250$ all work, so there are $\\boxed{50}$ values of $a$ that satisfy the given condition.", "Solution:\nFirst, note that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both integers.  To see this, note that $2^{(a+1)/2}$ is an integer for all integers $a$, so $d_1$ and $d_2$ are sums and differences of integers, and hence integers themselves.\n\nNow, $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of 5 when either $d_1$ or $d_2$ is a multiple of 5.  We consider these cases separately.\n\nIf $d_1$ is a multiple of 5, then $a^2 + 2^a$ is a multiple of 5.  By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, so $2^a \\equiv 2^{a \\bmod 4} \\pmod{5}$.  Hence, $a^2 + 2^a \\equiv a^2 + 2^{a \\bmod 4} \\pmod{5}$.  We can check that $2^0$, $2^1$, $2^2$, and $2^3$ are all distinct modulo 5, so $a^2 + 2^{a \\bmod 4}$ takes on all residues modulo 5 as $a$ varies over the integers.  Hence, $d_1$ is a multiple of 5 if and only if $a$ is a multiple of 5.\n\nIf $d_2$ is a multiple of 5, then $a^2 + 2^a$ is $a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$ modulo 5.  We can check that $2^0$, $2^1$, $2^2$, and $2^3$ are all distinct modulo 5, so $2^{(a+1)/2}$ takes on all residues modulo 5 as $a$ varies over the integers.  Hence, $d_2$ is a multiple of 5 if and only if $a^2 + 2^a$ is a multiple of 5 and $a$ is not a multiple of 5.\n\nWe conclude that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of 5 if and only if $a$ is a multiple of 5 or $a^2 + 2^a$ is a multiple of 5 and $a$ is not a multiple of 5.  The first condition holds for $50$ values of $a$ between 1 and 251, inclusive.  For the second condition, we can check that $a^2 + 2^a$ is not a multiple of 5 when $a \\equiv 1,2,3,4 \\pmod 5$.  Hence, there are $200/5 \\cdot 4 = 160$ values of $a$ between 1 and 251, inclusive, for which $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of 5.  Altogether, there are $50 + 160 = \\boxed{210}$ such values of $a$.", "Note that $d_1 - d_2 = 2a^2,$ so $d_1$ and $d_2$ have the same residue modulo 5.  Also, $d_1 + d_2 = 2a^2 + 2^{a+1},$ so $d_1 + d_2$ is always even.\n\nIf $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both multiples of 5, then $d_1 d_2$ is a multiple of 25.  This occurs if and only if $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both multiples of 5.\n\nNote that $2^{a+1}$ is always a multiple of 4, so $d_1 + d_2$ is always a multiple of 4.  Thus, $d_1$ and $d_2$ must have the same parity.\n\nIf $a$ is odd, then $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both even, so they are not multiples of 5.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both odd, so they are multiples of 5 if and only if they are equal to 5.  We have $d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2} \\ge 2^a > 5$ for $a \\ge 3,$ so we only need to check $a = 2$ and $a = 4.$\n\nFor $a = 2,$ $d_1 = 14$ and $d_2 = 2,$ so $d_1 d_2$ is not a multiple of 5.\n\nFor $a = 4,$ $d_1 = 78$ and $d_2 = 14,$ so $d_1 d_2$ is not a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore, the only possible values of $a$ are 1 and 251, and indeed, $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both multiples of 5 when $a = 1$ and $a = 251.$  Hence, there are $\\boxed{2}$ possible values of $a.$", "We start by factoring $d_1$ and $d_2$.\n\nFirst, we have\n$$d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2} = (a+2^{(a+1)/2})^2 - a\\cdot 2^{a/2}.$$Similarly, we can write\n$$d_2 = a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2} = (a-2^{(a+1)/2})^2 + a\\cdot 2^{a/2}.$$Thus, we have\n$$d_1 \\cdot d_2 = (a+2^{(a+1)/2})^2 \\cdot (a-2^{(a+1)/2})^2 - a^2\\cdot 2^a.$$We can now see that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$ if and only if $(a+2^{(a+1)/2})^2 \\cdot (a-2^{(a+1)/2})^2$ is a multiple of $5.$ Since $5$ is prime, this is true if and only if either $a+2^{(a+1)/2}$ or $a-2^{(a+1)/2}$ is a multiple of $5.$\n\nNote that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ implies that $2^{(a+1)/2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5},$ so $a-2^{(a+1)/2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}.$ On the other hand, if $a \\equiv 0,1,3 \\pmod{4},$ then $a+2^{(a+1)/2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ if and only if $a \\equiv 1,3 \\pmod{5}.$\n\nTherefore, there are $63$ choices of $a$ such that $a+2^{(a+1)/2}$ is a multiple of $5,$ and $50$ choices of $a$ such that $a-2^{(a+1)/2}$ is a multiple of $5.$ However, we have counted $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ twice, so we must subtract $14$ from the total. Thus, the answer is $63+50-14 = \\boxed{99}.$", "We first note that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both integers. Now, note that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$ if and only if $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both multiples of $5$ or one of them is a multiple of $5$ and the other is divisible by $5$. \n\nFirst, suppose that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are both multiples of $5$. Then, we need $a^2 + 2^a$ to be a multiple of $5$. For $1 \\le a \\le 4$, we can check that this is not satisfied. For $a \\ge 5$, we note that $a^2 + 2^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ implies that $a^2 \\equiv -2^a \\pmod{5}$. Since $a^2$ can only be $0$, $1$, or $4$ modulo $5$, we only need to check $2^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ for $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. This gives $a \\equiv 3, 7 \\pmod{10}$. Since $1 \\le a \\le 251$, there are $25$ solutions in this case.\n\nNow, suppose that one of $d_1$ and $d_2$ is a multiple of $5$ and the other is divisible by $5$.
