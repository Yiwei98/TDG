Let the two partitioned sets be $A$ and $B$; we will try to partition $3, 9, 27, 81,$ and $243$ such that the $ab=c$ condition is not satisfied. Without loss of generality, we place $3$ in $A$. Then $9$ must be placed in $B$, so $81$ must be placed in $A$, and $27$ must be placed in $B$.

Assume that there exists a partition of $S$ into two subsets such that neither subset contains a pair of elements $(a,b)$ with $ab$ equal to a third element in the subset. Let $p$ be the smallest prime greater than $\\frac{m}{2}$. Note that $p$ must exist since there is at least one prime in the interval $(\\frac{m}{2},m]$ and $p$ cannot be $2$. Let $T$ be the subset of $S$ containing all numbers whose prime factors are only 2 or primes less than or equal to $p$. Let $U$ be the subset of $S$ containing all other numbers in $S$. Since $p$ is the smallest prime greater than $\\frac{m}{2}$, every element of $T$ multiplied by another element of $T$ gives a product less than or equal to $m$. Therefore, none of these products can be in $U$. Thus, if we choose one element from $T$ and another element from $U$, their product cannot be in either set. Therefore, neither subset contains a pair of elements $(a,b)$ with $ab$ equal to a third element in the subset. However, this contradicts the fact that $3 \\in S$ and $3$ must be in some subset with two other elements whose product is equal to $3$. Therefore, every partition of $S$ into two subsets must contain a subset with three elements whose product is equal to the product of two of the elements in the subset.

Therefore, $m=\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest such integer.", "We claim that the answer is $m = 12$. To see that $m = 12$ works, note that $S$ has $10$ elements, so there are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to partition $S$ into two subsets. We will show that in each of these partitions, at least one of the subsets contains a triple $a$, $b$, and $c$ with $ab = c$.\n\nWe can list all the possible values of $ab$ for $a$, $b$ in $S$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n3 \\cdot 3 &= 9, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 4 &= 12, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 5 &= 15, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 6 &= 18, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 7 &= 21, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 8 &= 24, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 9 &= 27, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 4 &= 16, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 5 &= 20, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 6 &= 24, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 7 &= 28, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 8 &= 32, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 9 &= 36, \\\\\n5 \\cdot 5 &= 25, \\\\\n5 \\cdot 6 &= 30, \\\\\n5 \\cdot 7 &= 35, \\\\\n5 \\cdot 8 &= 40, \\\\\n5 \\cdot 9 &= 45, \\\\\n6 \\cdot 6 &= 36, \\\\\n6 \\cdot 7 &= 42, \\\\\n6 \\cdot 8 &= 48, \\\\\n6 \\cdot 9 &= 54, \\\\\n7 \\cdot 7 &= 49, \\\\\n7 \\cdot 8 &= 56, \\\\\n7 \\cdot 9 &= 63, \\\\\n8 \\cdot 8 &= 64, \\\\\n8 \\cdot 9 &= 72, \\\\\n9 \\cdot 9 &= 81.\n\\end{align*}\nNote that there are $28$ different values in this list, and $28 > 2 \\cdot 10 = 20$.

This is $40$ numbers, which is more than half of $S$. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, one of $A$ or $B$ must contain at least $21$ of these numbers. But if any subset of $S$ contains three numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $ab = c$, then $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be three distinct primes.

Thus, $N$ can be expressed as the sum of $j$ consecutive odd integers if and only if $j(n-4)+10+8+6+4+2$ is the sum of $j$ consecutive odd integers whose middle number is $n-2$. If $j$ is odd, then $j$ consecutive odd integers whose middle number is $n-2$ is just $j(n-2)$, so $N$ can be expressed as the sum of $j$ consecutive odd integers for odd $j$ if and only if $n$ is odd. If $j$ is even, then $j$ consecutive odd integers whose middle number is $n-2$ is the sum of two consecutive sequences of odd integers, so $N$ can be expressed as the sum of $j$ consecutive odd integers for even $j$ if and only if $n$ is odd and $j/2$ is greater than the number of odd integers less than $n-2$, which is $(n-3)/2$. Thus, we have the following cases:\n\nIf $j=1$, then $n=N$ must be odd and $1\\le N<1000$, giving $500$ values of $N$.\nIf $j=3$, then $n=N/3$ must be odd and $3\\le N<3000$, giving $500$ values of $N$.\nIf $j=5$, then $n=N/5$ must be odd and $5\\le N<5000$, giving $500$ values of $N$.\nIf $j=7$, then $n=N/7$ must be odd and $(7\\cdot 3)<N<7000$, giving $499$ values of $N$.\nIf $j=9$, then $n=N/9$ must be odd and $(9\\cdot 5)<N<9000$, giving $499$ values of $N$.\n\nThus, there are $500+500+500+499+499=\\boxed{2498}$ values of $N$.", "Suppose that $N$ is the sum of $j$ consecutive odd integers, beginning with $2n+1$. Then this sum is equal to $j(2n+1)$. We want to find all integers $N$ that can be represented in five ways as\n$$N=j_1(2n_1+1)=j_2(2n_2+1)=j_3(2n_3+1)=j_4(2n_4+1)=j_5(2n_5+1)$$\nwith $j_1<j_2<j_3<j_4<j_5$, $j_i$ odd, and $n_i$ nonnegative integers. Since $N$ is odd, we know that $j_1$ is odd. We claim that $j_1$ must be a divisor of $N$. To see this, let $d=\\gcd(j_1,2n_1+1)$. Then we can write $j_1=de$ and $2n_1+1=df$ for some integers $e$ and $f$. Then $N=j_1(2n_1+1)=d^2ef$. Since $d$ divides the left side, it must divide the right side, so $d$ is a divisor of $N$.\n\nIt follows that the smallest possible value of $j_1$ is 1, and the largest possible value is $N$. Thus, there are at most $N$ possible values for $j_1$. If $N$ is even, then there are no odd divisors of $N$, so we can immediately discard these cases. If $N$ is odd, then we know that $j_1$ is odd and is a divisor of $N$, so there are $\\frac{\\sigma(N)-1}{2}$ possible values of $j_1$, where $\\sigma(N)$ is the number of divisors of $N$.\n\nWe now claim that there is at most one possible value of $j_1$ for each $N$. Suppose otherwise, that $N$ can be written as $j_1(2n_1+1)=j_2(2n_2+1)$, where $j_1<j_2$. Then $j_2-j_1$ is a positive odd integer that divides $N$, and $j_2=j_1+k$ for some positive odd integer $k$. Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\nj_2(2n_2+1)-j_1(2n_1+1) &= k(2n_1+1)+j_1(2n_2-2n_1) \\\\\n&= k(2n_1+1)+2j_1(n_2-n_1)\n\\end{align*}\nSince $k$ is odd and $2n_1+1$ is odd, $k(2n_1+1)$ is odd, so $j_2(2n_2+1)-j_1(2n_1+1)$ is odd. But this is impossible, since $j_2(2n_2+1)-j_1(2n_1+1)$ is even for any two odd integers $j_1$ and $j_2$.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one possible value of $j_1$ for each odd $N$, and the answer is the number of odd integers less than 1000, which is $\\boxed{500}$.", "Let $n$ be the smallest odd integer in the sum. Then the next $j-1$ odd integers are $n+2, n+4, \\dots, n+2(j-1)$. The sum of this arithmetic sequence is $j\\cdot \\frac{2n+2(j-1)}{2} = j(n+j-1)$.\n\nIf $j=1$, then the sum is just $n$, which is an odd integer. If $j=2$, then the sum is $2n+2$, which is an even integer. If $j=3$, then the sum is $3n+3$, which is an odd integer. If $j=4$, then the sum is $4n+6$, which is an even integer. If $j=5$, then the sum is $5n+10$, which is an even integer.\n\nTherefore, the sum can be odd for $j=1$ and $j=3$, and even for $j=2$, $j=4$, and $j=5$. In order for $N$ to be an odd integer, $j$ must be an odd integer. In order for $N$ to be an even integer, $j$ must be an even integer.\n\nIf $j$ is odd, then $j=1$ or $j=3$. If $j=1$, then $n$ can be any odd integer less than $1000$. If $j=3$, then $n$ can be any odd integer such that $3n+3 < 1000$, or $n<332$. There are 166 odd integers less than 332, so there are 166 values of $n$.\n\nIf $j$ is even, then $j=2$, $j=4$, or $j=5$. If $j=2$, then $N$ is even, and $n$ can be any odd integer less than 499. There are 249 odd integers less than 499, so there are 249 values of $n$. If $j=4$, then $N$ is even, and $n$ can be any odd integer such that $4n+6<1000$, or $n<248$. There are 124 odd integers less than 248, so there are 124 values of $n$. If $j=5$, then $N$ is even, and $n$ can be any odd integer such that $5n+10<1000$, or $n<198$. There are 99 odd integers less than 198, so there are 99 values of $n$.\n\nIn total, there are $1+166+249+124+99=\\boxed{639}$ integers $N$ that can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers, where $j$ is from exactly 5 values of $j\\ge 1$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Number Theory"}
