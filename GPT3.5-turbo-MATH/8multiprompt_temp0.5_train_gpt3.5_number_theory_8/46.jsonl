The probability that we select a 4 is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.$", "Solution:\nWe have $\\frac{5}{7}=0.\\overline{714285}$. Since the digits repeat every 6 places, the probability that a randomly selected digit is a 4 is equal to the fraction of digits that are 4's in the repeating block $714285$.

Therefore, the probability that the randomly selected digit is 4 is equal to the fraction of digits in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ that are 4's.  Since each digit has an equal chance of being selected, this probability is equal to the fraction of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ that is 4's.  The decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714}$, which has three digits that are 4's, and a total of three digits.
