Since $712n$ is even, we just need to check whether it is divisible by 9.\n\nThe sum of the digits of $712n$ is $7+1+2+n=10+n$.  Since $712n$ is divisible by 9, $10+n$ must also be divisible by 9.  The only digit that makes this true is $n=\\boxed{7}$.", "Solution:\nFor a number to be divisible by 18, it must be divisible by 9 and by 2. If a number is divisible by 2, then its units digit is even. Thus $n$ must be even. If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of $712n$ is $10+n$, so $10+n$ must be divisible by 9. Thus $n=8$ is the only even digit that works, since $10+8=18$. Thus the number is $7128$, which is divisible by 18. Therefore, $n=\\boxed{8}$."], "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory"}
