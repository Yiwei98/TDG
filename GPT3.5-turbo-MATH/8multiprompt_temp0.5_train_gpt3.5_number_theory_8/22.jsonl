The prime factorization of $600$ is $600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nNotice that $A$ is the sum of $1$ and an even number and $B$ is the sum of $1$ and a number divisible by $3$. Thus, $A$ is odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$. It follows that $A$ is divisible by $3$ and $B$ is divisible by $2^3$. We now have three separate cases: $(A,B) = (3 \\cdot 25,8), (3 \\cdot 5, 8 \\cdot 5), (3, 8 \\cdot 25)$.\n\nIn the first case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 8$; for $j = 1$, we have that $1 + 3 = 4 < 8$, and for $j = 2$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 = 13 > 8$. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\nFor the third case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 200$; for $j = 4$, then $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 < 200$, and for $j = 5$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 > 200$. Thus, this case is also not possible.\n\nIt follows that $(A,B) = (15, 40)$, in which case we find that $i = j = 3$ works. Thus, the answer is $3 + 3 = \\boxed{6}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nThe sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is equal to $(1 + 2 + \\dots + 2^i)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + \\dots + 3^j).$  We want this product to be equal to 600.\n\nWe can write\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + 2 + \\dots + 2^i &= 2^{i + 1} - 1, \\\\\n1 + 3 + 3^2 + \\dots + 3^j &= \\frac{3^{j + 1} - 1}{2}.\n\\end{align*}Hence, we want\n\\[(2^{i + 1} - 1) \\cdot \\frac{3^{j + 1} - 1}{2} = 600.\\]Since $600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2,$ we want $i + 1 = 3,$ $j + 1 = 2,$ and $2^{i + 2} \\cdot 3^{j + 1} = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$  Hence, $i = 2$ and $j = 1,$ so $i + j = \\boxed{3}.$", "Solution:\nThe sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is given by $(1 + 2 + \\dots + 2^i)(1 + 3 + \\dots + 3^j)$.
