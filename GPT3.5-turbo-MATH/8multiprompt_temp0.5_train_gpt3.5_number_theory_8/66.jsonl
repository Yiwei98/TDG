If Cindy has 2 piles, then the number of coins in each pile must divide $N$ (since the total number of coins must be divisible by the number of piles).  Also, we know that $Y$ can take on 13 different values.  The divisors of 13 are 1 and 13, so the only possibilities for $Y$ are 2 and 13.  If $Y=2,$ then $N$ must be even (since each pile has an even number of coins), and the smallest value of $N$ that works is $2+2=4.$  If $Y=13,$ then $N$ must be a multiple of 13 (since each pile has 13 coins), and the smallest value of $N$ that works is $13+13=26.$\n\nNow let's try $X=3.$  If Cindy has 3 piles, then the number of coins in each pile must divide $N.$  Also, $Y$ can take on 13 different values.

We want the smallest value of $N$ that works, so we start with $Y=2$ and work our way up.  If $Y=2,$ then each pile must have an even number of coins, so $N$ must be even.  The smallest value of $N$ that works is $2+2+2=6.$  If $Y=3,$ then each pile must have a number of coins that is a multiple of 3, so $N$ must be a multiple of 3.  The smallest value of $N$ that works is $3+3+3=9.$  If $Y=4,$ then each pile must have a number of coins that is a multiple of 4, so $N$ must be a multiple of 4.  The smallest value of $N$ that works is $4+4+4=12.$  If $Y=6,$ then each pile must have a number of coins that is a multiple of 6, so $N$ must be a multiple of 6.  The smallest value of $N$ that works is $6+6+6=18.$  If $Y=13,$ then each pile must have 13 coins, so $N$ must be a multiple of 13.  The smallest value of $N$ that works is $13+13+13=39.$  We can stop here, since the smallest value of $N$ we have found is 6, which is smaller than 12 and 18.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of coins Cindy could have is $\\boxed{6}.$", "Solution:\nLet $N$ be the total number of coins.
