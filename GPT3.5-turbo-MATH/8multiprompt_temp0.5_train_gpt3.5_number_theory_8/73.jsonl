Also, $n!$ is divisible by $n$ but not $n + 1,$ so\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, (n + 1)! + (n + 1)) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n(n!) + (n + 1)) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n + 1).\n\\end{align*}Note that $n! + n$ is odd, so $\\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n + 1)$ is odd.  Also, $\\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n + 1) \\le n + 1.$\n\nIf $n + 1$ is composite, then $\\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n + 1) = n + 1,$ which is not maximum possible value.
