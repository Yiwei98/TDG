Factoring the quadratic gives $(a-2)(7a+31)=0$. Since $a$ must be a digit, $a = \\boxed{2}$.", "Solution:\nWe start by looking at the rightmost digits of the numbers being added. The units digit of $293_{a}$ is $3$, and the units digit of $468_{a}$ is $8$. When we add these two numbers, we get a units digit of $1$ (since $3+8=11$, but we are working in base $a$, so we carry the $1$ over to the next column).\n\nNext, we look at the second digit from the right in each number. The digit in this place in $293_{a}$ is $9$, and the digit in this place in $468_{a}$ is $6$. When we add these two numbers, we get a sum of $15$, which is $1a+5$ in base $a$.

Since $B_{a}=11_{10}$, we have $1B_{a}=1a_{11}$, so we can write the equation $9+a+6=1a_{11}$.  Solving for $a$, we get $a=15$.  We can check that this solution works: $293_{15}+468_{15}=6B1_{15}$, and $6B1_{15}=11_{10}$.  Thus, the value of $a$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{15}$.", "Solution:\nWe begin by adding the numbers in the rightmost column, which gives us $3+8$.

Adding the numbers in the second column, we have $9+a+6$, which again is greater than or equal to $11_{10}$. Therefore, we carry over a digit to the third column, which gives us $7a+3$. Finally, adding the numbers in the third column, we have $2+4+7a$, which equals $7a+6$.

Since $3_a + 6_a$ is a two-digit number, we must carry over a digit from the ones place to the $a^2$ place. Thus, we have $9+9=18$ in the $a^1$ place, and $2_a + 4_a + 1 = 13_a$ in the $a^2$ place. We carry over a digit to the $a^3$ place, giving us $2_a + 1_a + 1 = 4_a$ in the $a^3$ place. Finally, we have $7_a + 0_a + 0_a = 7_a$ in the $a^4$ place.

Thus, we must have\n\\[\\frac{8d + 4}{1000} \\ge v.\\]Solving for $v,$ we find $v \\le \\frac{2}{5} d.$\n\nTherefore, we want to choose $d$ to maximize $M,$ subject to the constraints\n\\[\\frac{4v + 60}{375} \\le d \\le \\frac{8v + 16}{375},\\]and\n\\[v \\le \\frac{2}{5} d.\\]The last inequality becomes $5v \\le 2d.$\n\nWe can eliminate $v$ to get\n\\[\\frac{4d + 60}{375} \\le d \\le \\frac{8d + 32}{375},\\]and\n\\[5d \\le 750.\\]Thus, $d$ can be any value between $\\frac{15}{4}$ meters and $150$ meters.
