Then $a = dm$ and $b = dn$ for relatively prime integers $m$ and $n$. We have $dm - dn = 6$, so $d(m-n) = 6$. Since $d$ divides $a^2 + b^2$, it also divides $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2$. Therefore, $d$ divides $(m+n)^2$.\n\nSince $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $m+n$ and $m-n$ are relatively prime. Thus, from $d(m-n) = 6$ and $d$ divides $(m+n)^2$, we conclude that $d$ divides $m+n$ and $m-n$. Since $d$ is relatively prime to $m$ and $n$, it follows that $d$ divides $m+n$ and $m-n$ without the $d$, so $d$ divides 6 and $d$ divides $m+n$ and $m-n$. Thus, $d$ must be 1, 2, 3, or 6.\n\nWe have\n\\[\\gcd((a+b)^2, ab) = \\gcd((d(m+n))^2, d^2mn).\\]If $d = 1$, then this is just $\\gcd((m+n)^2, mn)$. If $d = 2$, then we must have $m+n$ odd, so $m$ and $n$ are odd, and $mn$ is odd. Thus, $\\gcd((2(m+n))^2, 2^3mn) = 4\\gcd((m+n)^2, mn)$. Similarly, if $d = 3$, then $\\gcd((3(m+n))^2, 3^2mn) = 9\\gcd((m+n)^2, mn)$.

The equation $d(m-n) = 6$ then becomes $d(p^2 - q^2) = 6$, which is impossible since $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime.\n\nThe second equation implies that $mn$ is twice a perfect square. Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd, it follows that $m = 2p^2$ and $n = 2q^2$ for some relatively prime integers $p$ and $q$. The equation $d(m-n) = 6$ then becomes $d(p^2 - q^2) = 3$, which is impossible since $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime.\n\nThe third equation implies that $mn$ is three times a perfect square. Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd, it follows that $m = 3p^2$ and $n = 3q^2$ for some relatively prime integers $p$ and $q$. The equation $d(m-n) = 6$ then becomes $d(p^2 - q^2) = 2$. Since $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, we must have $p > q$. Thus, $p^2 - q^2 \\geq (q+1)^2 - q^2 = 2q+1$, so $d \\leq \\frac{2}{2q+1} < 1$. Thus, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nThe fourth equation implies that $mn$ is eighteen times a perfect square. Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd, it follows that $m = 18p^2$ and $n = 18q^2$ for some relatively prime integers $p$ and $q$. The equation $d(m-n) = 6$ then becomes $d(p^2 - q^2) = 1$. Since $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, we must have $p > q$. Thus, $p^2 - q^2 \\geq (q+1)^2 - q^2 = 2q+1$, so $d \\leq \\frac{1}{2q+1}$. Since $d$ is a divisor of 18, the only possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We consider these cases separately.\n\nIf $d = 1$, then $p^2 - q^2 = 1$, which implies $(p+q)(p-q) = 1$. This is only possible if $p = q+1$, in which case we have $p = 2$ and $q = 1$. Thus, $m = 18 \\cdot 2^2 = 72$ and $n = 18 \\cdot 1^2 = 18$. We have $a = 72k$ and $b = 18k$ for some integer $k$, and $a-b = 54 = 2 \\cdot 3^3$.

Thus, we can rewrite the $\\gcd$ as $$\\gcd\\left(\\frac{(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)}{a+b}, ab\\right) = \\gcd(a^2-ab+b^2, ab).$$Let $d = \\gcd(a,b)$ and let $a = dm$, $b = dn$ with $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$. Then $a-b = (d)(m-n) = 6$, so $d$ divides 6. We consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $d=1$.\nIn this case, $m-n=6$. We have $$\\gcd(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) = \\gcd(d^2(m^2-mn+n^2), dmn) = d\\gcd(m^2-mn+n^2, mn).$$Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$, we have $\\gcd(m^2-mn+n^2, mn) = 1$, so $\\gcd(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) = d = 1$. Thus, $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$ are relatively prime. We have $$\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b} = a^2-ab+b^2 = d^2(m^2-mn+n^2) = m^2-mn+n^2.$$Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, we have $m^2-mn+n^2 \\equiv 1-1+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $m^2-mn+n^2 \\equiv 1+1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $m^2-mn+n^2$ is a multiple of 6.

We have $$\\gcd(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) = \\gcd(4(m^2-mn+n^2), 2mn) = 2\\gcd(m^2-mn+n^2, mn).$$We have $$a^2-ab+b^2 = 4(m^2-mn+n^2) = 4(n^2+6n+9-n(n+3)+n^2) = 12n^2+24n+36 = 12(n+1)^2,$$so $\\gcd(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) = 2$ if and only if $\\gcd(n+1, m) = 1$ and $\\gcd(n+1, n) = 2$. Since $\\gcd(n+1, n) = 1$, we must have $\\gcd(n+1, 2) = 2$, so $n$ is odd. Since $\\gcd(n+1, m) = 1$, we have $\\gcd(n+4, m) = 1$. Thus, $m$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ are both even. Let $a=2a'$ and $b=2b'$. Then $a'-b' = 3$ and $$\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b} = \\frac{8(a'^3+b'^3)}{a'+b'}.$$Since $\\gcd(a'+b', 4a'b') = 1$, we have $\\gcd\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = \\gcd(2(a'^3+b'^3), 4a'b') = 2\\gcd(a'^3+b'^3, 2a'b')$. Note that $a'^3+b'^3$ is odd since $a'-b' = 3$ and $a'$ and $b'$ are both odd. Thus, $\\gcd(a'^3+b'^3, 2a'b') = 1$ or 3. If $\\gcd(a'^3+b'^3, 2a'b') = 1$, then $\\gcd\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = 2$, which is not possible. Thus, $\\gcd(a'^3+b'^3, 2a'b') = 3$. Since $a'^3+b'^3$ is odd, we have $3 | a'^3+b'^3$, so $3 | a'^3$ and $3 | b'^3$. Thus, $3 | a'$ and $3 | b'$, so $9 | a'^3+b'^3$. We have $$\\gcd\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = 2\\gcd(a'^3+b'^3, 2a'b') = 6,$$so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{6}$.", "Let $x=a+b$.

Since $9$ divides both $108-2x^2$ and $x^2-36$, it must divide their difference, which is $2(x^2-36)-(108-2x^2)=4x^2-144$. Thus, $4x^2-144$ must be a multiple of $9$, so $x^2=36+9k$ for some non-negative integer $k$. The smallest such $x$ is $x=3\\sqrt{5}$, which gives $b=\\frac{x+6}{2}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}+6}{2}$.

This contradicts the fact that $\\text{gcd}(ab, 36) = 9$. Therefore, $\\text{gcd}(5+k, 9) = 3$, so $k$ must be a multiple of $3$, say $k=3m$. Then $a-b=6$ implies $b^2+6b-27m=0$, so $b$ is a multiple of $3$. Since $b$ is positive, the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{3}$.", "Solution:\nWe begin by using the factorization $a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$ to rewrite the gcd as \\[\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a+b}{3},ab\\right).\\]Since $a-b=6$, we can write $a=b+6$.

We can use these facts to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, we know that $e$ must be even, so $e$ can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  If $e=0$, then $d$ must be 0 as well, which is not allowed since $d$ is a digit.  If $e=2$, then the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $5+d$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $5+2=7$.  Thus, $5+d-7=-2$ must be a multiple of 11, which is not possible since $d$ is a digit.  If $e=4$, then the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $5+d$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $5+2=7$.  Thus, $5+d-7=-2$ must be a multiple of 11, so $d=4$ is a solution.\n\nIf $e=6$, then the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $5+d$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $5+2=7$.  Thus, $5+d-7=-2$ must be a multiple of 11, so $d=4$ is a solution.  If $e=8$, then the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $5+d$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $5+2=7$.  Thus, $5+d-7=-2$ must be a multiple of 11, which is not possible since $d$ is a digit.\n\nTherefore, the two solutions are $455,\\!224$ and $655,\\!344$, and the maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{5}$.", "We know that a number is divisible by 22 if it is divisible by both 11 and 2. A number is divisible by 11 if the sum of the digits in the odd places subtracted by the sum of the digits in the even places is divisible by 11. For $5d5,\\!22e$, the sum of the digits in the odd places is $5+5+2=12$, and the sum of the digits in the even places is $d+2+e$. Therefore, $12-(d+2+e)$ must be divisible by 11. Simplifying, we get $d+e\\equiv 1\\pmod{11}$. \n\nSince the number must be even, $e$ must be even. The only even digit that works is $e=4$. Therefore, $d\\equiv 7\\pmod{11}$. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is $d=9$. Therefore, the maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{9}$. \n\nThe multiples of 22 of the form $5d5,\\!224$ are $550,\\!224$, $572,\\!242$, and $594,\\!260$.", "For a number in the form of $5d5,\\!22e$ to be divisible by 22, we must have that $22e - 5d5$ is divisible by 22.  Since $5d5$ is divisible by 5, but not by 11, we must have $22e - 5d5$ divisible by 11.  Thus, we must have $2e + 5d$ divisible by 11.  The 6-digit multiples of 22 are those between 110,000 and 999,998 that are divisible by 22, so we consider the range $110,\\!000$ to $999,\\!998.$\n\nThe smallest multiple of 22 in this range is $110,\\!022 = 5 \\cdot 22004.$  The largest multiple of 22 in this range is $999,\\!978 = 22 \\cdot 45453.$  Thus, the possible values of $e$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the possible values of $d$ are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nIf $e = 0,$ then $d$ must be even, so $d$ can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nIf $e = 1,$ then $2e + 5d = 7$ is not divisible by 11, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nIf $e = 2,$ then $2e + 5d = 12$ is divisible by 11, so $d$ can be 1 or 6.\n\nIf $e = 3,$ then $2e + 5d = 17$ is not divisible by 11, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nIf $e = 4,$ then $2e + 5d = 22$ is divisible by 11, so $d$ can be 2 or 7.\n\nIf $e = 5,$ then $2e + 5d = 27$ is not divisible by 11, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nThe maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{9}.$", "We know that the number $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 22, so we know that $5e - d - 5 \\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$.
