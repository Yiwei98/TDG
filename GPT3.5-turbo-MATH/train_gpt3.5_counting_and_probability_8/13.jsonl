Therefore, there are $10^{n-3}\\cdot 9^{n-3}$ sequences of length $n$ that end with $0$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sequences that end with $0$ is $100+1000+900+7200+\\cdots+10^6\\cdot 9^6$.

Since $a_{n-1}$ is positive, $|a_{n-2}-a_{n-3}|$ must be zero.  Thus, $a_{n-2}=a_{n-3}$, and in fact, all subsequent terms are equal.  Thus, the sequence is determined by its first three terms.  There are $10^3$ ways to choose the first three terms, but we must subtract off the number of sequences that never hit zero.  If $a_{n-2} \\neq a_{n-3}$ for some $n$, then $|a_{n-2}-a_{n-3}| \\ge 1$.  Thus, the sequence grows exponentially, and it can never hit zero.

There are then $9$ choices for $a_2$, and $8$ choices for $a_3$.  Finally, there are $2^6$ choices for $a_4,a_5,\\ldots,a_{10}$, since each term can be $1$ or $2$ times the previous term.

We can continue this argument, and deduce that $a_2=a_1$ or $a_3=a_2=a_1$. Therefore, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of ordered triples $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ with $a_1,a_2,a_3$ all equal or only $a_1$ and $a_3$ equal. There are $10$ choices for each of $a_1,a_2,a_3$, so there are $10^3$ ordered triples total.
