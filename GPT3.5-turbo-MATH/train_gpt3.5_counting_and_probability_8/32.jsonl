This fraction is already in lowest terms, so the answer is $43+1296=\\boxed{1339}$.", "Solution:\nA product of four integers is a perfect square if and only if the exponents of the primes in its prime factorization are all even. The prime factorization of any perfect square is thus of the form $2^{2a} \\cdot 3^{2b} \\cdot 5^{2c}$ for some nonnegative integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nWe count the number of ways that the four dice rolls can be assigned to the exponents of $2$, $3$, and $5$. The exponent of $2$ can be any even integer from $0$ to $4$, so there are $3$ choices for its value. The exponent of $3$ can be either $0$ or $2$, so there are $2$ choices for its value. The exponent of $5$ can also be either $0$ or $2$, so there are $2$ choices for its value. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12$ ways to assign the dice rolls to the exponents of $2$, $3$, and $5$.\n\nFor each of these assignments, we have $6$ choices for the value of the exponent of $2$, $2$ choices for the value of the exponent of $3$, and $2$ choices for the value of the exponent of $5$. Therefore, there are $6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to choose the actual values of the exponents once we have assigned the dice rolls to them.\n\nFor example, if we assign the four dice rolls to the exponents of $2$, $3$, and $5$ in the order $(2,5,3,2)$, then we can choose the actual values of the exponents to be $(2,0,2)$, $(2,2,0)$, $(4,0,0)$, $(4,2,2)$, $(0,2,2)$, $(0,0,2)$, $(2,2,2)$, $(4,0,2)$, $(4,2,0)$, $(0,2,0)$, $(2,0,0)$, or $(0,0,0)$.\n\nFor each of the $24$ ways to choose the actual values of the exponents, there are $3^4 = 81$ ways to assign the dice rolls to those exponents. Thus, there are $24 \\cdot 81 = 1944$ successful outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $6^4 = 1296$. Therefore, the probability that the product of the four dice rolls is a perfect square is $\\frac{1944}{1296} = \\frac{3}{2}$, and $m + n = \\boxed{5}$."], "level": "Level 5", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
