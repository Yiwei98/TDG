We can count each of these separately using the same method as before.  For example, if John and Wilma sit in three consecutive seats, we can think of John and Wilma as a \"block\" which can be arranged in 2 ways (John-Wilma or Wilma-John).  Then we can arrange the remaining 5 people and the block in $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2$ ways.

{"question": "Problem:\nTwo distinct numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. What is the probability that their product is an even number?

This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd. There are a total of ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers.
