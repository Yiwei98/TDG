There are three choices for the color of the hexagon surrounding the red hexagon.  Once that is chosen, there are two choices for the color of the hexagon immediately adjacent to the red hexagon.  Continuing in this way, we find that there is only one choice for the color of the red hexagon.  Thus, there are $3\\cdot2^5\\cdot1=\\boxed{96}$ ways to color the figure.", "Solution:\nWe work from left to right.  There are 3 ways to color the leftmost hexagon.  For the second hexagon, there are two choices, since it cannot be the same color as the first.  For the third hexagon, there are two choices, since it cannot be the same color as the second.  For the fourth hexagon, there are two choices, since it cannot be the same color as the third.  For the fifth hexagon, there are two choices, since it cannot be the same color as the fourth.  Finally, there is only one choice for the rightmost hexagon, since it cannot be the same color as the fifth.
