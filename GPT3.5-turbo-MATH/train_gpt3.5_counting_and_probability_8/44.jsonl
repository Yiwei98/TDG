If we remove the next row, we remove $6$ toothpicks and $8$ triangles.  Continuing in this way, we can remove $4+8+10+10+8+4 = 44$ toothpicks and $25$ triangles.\n\nIf we remove $43$ toothpicks, we can remove all but one triangle.  Therefore, the fewest number of toothpicks that could be removed so that no triangles remain is $\\boxed{44}.$"], "level": "Level 4", "type": "Counting & Probability"}
