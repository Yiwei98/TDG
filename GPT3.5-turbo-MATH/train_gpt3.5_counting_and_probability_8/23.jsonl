That is, in how many ways can we choose a chief, 2 supporting chiefs, and two inferior officers reporting to each supporting chief?", "answer": "There are 10 choices for the chief.  For each choice, there are 9 ways to choose supporting chief A, then 8 ways to choose supporting chief B.  There are then $\\binom{7}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief A and $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief B.  This gives us a total of $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2}\\cdot\\binom{5}{2} = \\boxed{151200}$ ways to form the leadership of the tribe.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nWe choose the chief in 1 way.  We choose the supporting chiefs in $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways.  We choose the inferiors for each supporting chief in $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way.

We can choose the chief in 1 way.  After the chief is chosen, we must choose 2 people to be supporting chief A and supporting chief B from the remaining 9 people.  We can do this in $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ ways.  After the supporting chiefs are chosen, we must choose 2 people to report to each supporting chief.  We can do this in $\\binom{2}{2}\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way for each supporting chief, since there are only 2 people left for each supporting chief to choose from.

We can choose the supporting chiefs in $\\binom{2}{1}=2$ ways.  We can choose the two inferior officers reporting to supporting chief A in $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways.  Finally, we can choose the two inferior officers reporting to supporting chief B in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways.

After a chief is chosen, there are 2 people left to choose for the position of supporting chief A.  Then there is only 1 person left to choose for the position of supporting chief B.  The two remaining people must be the inferior officers for supporting chief A, so there are 2 ways to choose them.  The remaining two people must be the inferior officers for supporting chief B, so there are also 2 ways to choose them.
