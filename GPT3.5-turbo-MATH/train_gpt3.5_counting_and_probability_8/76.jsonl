Then $S_2$ contains 12 multiples of 19 and 20 multiples of 31, so $|S_2| = 32.$\n\nLet $S_3$ be the set of digits that can follow a digit in $S_2.$  For example, if the string contains 31, then $S_3$ contains the digit that follows the 1 in 31.\n\nIf $n$ is a multiple of 19 or 31, then the possibilities for the units digit of $n$ are 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 9.  Therefore, $S_3$ is a subset of $\\{0,3,4,6,7,9\\}.$  Furthermore, if $d_i \\in S_3,$ then $d_{i + 1} \\in S_3.$\n\nLet $S_4$ be the set of digits that can follow a digit in $S_3.$  Then $S_4$ is a subset of $\\{0,3,4,6,7,9\\},$ and if $d_i \\in S_4,$ then $d_{i + 1} \\in S_3.$\n\nSince $|S_4| \\le 6,$ we conclude that there exist digits $d_2,$ $d_3,$ $\\dots,$ $d_{2002}$ such that $d_i \\in S_4$ for $2 \\le i \\le 2002.$  The largest such digit is $\\boxed{9}.$", "We first note that if a two-digit number is divisible by 19 or 31, then it must be divisible by 589. Thus, we can write the string of digits as $1a_2a_3\\ldots a_{2002}$ and note that $a_2a_3, a_3a_4, \\ldots, a_{2001}a_{2002}$ are all divisible by 589. We know that $100a_2 + a_3$ is divisible by 589, so we can write $100a_2 + a_3 = 589k_1$ for some integer $k_1$. Similarly, we can write $100a_3 + a_4 = 589k_2$ for some integer $k_2$. Combining these two equations, we get $100a_2 + a_3 + 100a_3 + a_4 = 100a_2 + 101a_3 + a_4 = 589(k_1 + k_2)$. Thus, $101a_3$ is divisible by 589, so $a_3 = 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1$. If $a_3 = 0$, then $a_2 = 5$, which is impossible since the first digit is 1. If $a_3 = 9$, then $a_4 = 5$, which is impossible since 95 is not divisible by 19 or 31. If $a_3 = 8$, then $a_4 = 1$ or $a_4 = 7$. If $a_3 = 7$, then $a_4 = 3$ or $a_4 = 9$. If $a_3 = 6$, then $a_4 = 5$. If $a_3 = 5$, then $a_4 = 1$ or $a_4 = 7$. If $a_3 = 4$, then $a_4 = 3$ or $a_4 = 9$. If $a_3 = 3$, then $a_4 = 5$. If $a_3 = 2$, then $a_4 = 1$ or $a_4 = 7$. If $a_3 = 1$, then $a_4 = 3$ or $a_4 = 9$.
