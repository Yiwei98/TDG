Via a standard stars and bars argument, the number of ways to partition 6 into 5 non-negative parts is $\\binom{6+4}4 = \\binom{10}4 = 210$. The interesting quadruples correspond to partitions where the second number is less than the fourth. By symmetry, there are as many partitions where the fourth is less than the second. So, if $N$ is the number of partitions where the second element is equal to the fourth, our answer is $(210-N)/2$.\nWe find $N$ as a sum of 4 cases:\ntwo parts equal to zero, $\\binom82 = 28$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to one, $\\binom62 = 15$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to two, $\\binom42 = 6$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to three, $\\binom22 = 1$ way.\nTherefore, $N = 28 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 50$ and our answer is $(210 - 50)/2 = \\boxed{80}$.", "generated_answer": ["Solution:\nLet $a = 1 + x,$ $b = 2 + y,$ $c = 3 + z,$ and $d = 4 + w.$  Then $x,$ $y,$ $z,$ $w$ are non-negative integers, and $x + w > y + z.$  Furthermore, $w \\le 5,$ $z \\le 4,$ $y \\le 3,$ and $x \\le 2.$\n\nLet $S$ denote the number of interesting ordered quadruples $(a,b,c,d).$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nS &= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{w = 0}^5 [x + w > y + z] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{w = 0}^5 [w - z > y - x] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{w = 0}^5 \\sum_{k = y - x + 1}^6 [w - z = k] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^4 \\sum_{w = k + z}^5 \\sum_{i = k + y - x}^6 1 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^4 (6 - k - z - \\max(0,k + y - x - z))^+ \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} (6 - k - z - \\max(0,k + y - x - z)) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} (6 - k - z) - \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} \\max(0,k + y - x - z).\n\\end{align*}The first sum is\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} (6 - k - z) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (6 - z) \\cdot \\min(4,6 - z) - \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\frac{(\\min(4,6 - z) + 1)(\\min(4,6 - z))}{2} \\\\\n&= 10 \\cdot \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 (6 - z) - \\frac{15 \\cdot 5}{2} \\\\\n&= 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 - \\frac{15 \\cdot 5}{2} \\\\\n&= 285.\n\\end{align*}The second sum is\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} \\max(0,k + y - x - z) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = \\max(1,z - y + x + 1)}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} (k + y - x - z) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\left( \\sum_{k = \\max(1,z - y + x + 1)}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} k \\right) + \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\left( \\sum_{k = \\max(1,z - y + x + 1)}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} y - x - z \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\frac{(\\min(4,6 - z) + \\max(0,z - y - x))^2 - (\\max(0,z - y - x))^2}{2} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (\\min(4,6 - z) - \\max(0,z - y - x))(y - x - z) \\\\\n&= 0 + \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (\\min(4,6 - z) - \\max(0,z - y - x))(y - x - z) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (y - x - z) \\cdot (\\min(4,6 - z) - \\max(0,z - y - x)) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (y - x - z) \\cdot (5 - z - \\max(0,z - y - x)).\n\\end{align*}Let $T = \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (y - x - z) \\cdot \\max(0,z - y - x).$  We compute $T$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nT &= \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{x = 0}^y (y - x - z) \\cdot (z - y + x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\left( z \\cdot \\sum_{x = 0}^y x - y \\cdot \\sum_{x = 0}^y x + \\sum_{x = 0}^y xy - z \\cdot \\sum_{x = 0}^y 1 \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\left( z \\cdot \\frac{y(y + 1)}{2} - y \\cdot \\frac{y(y + 1)}{2} + \\frac{y(y + 1)(2y + 1)}{6} - z \\cdot (y + 1) \\right) \\\\\n&= 0.\n\\end{align*}Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nS &= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} (6 - k - z) - T \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\min(4,6 - z)} (6 - k - z) \\\\\n&= 4 \\cdot \\sum_{x = 0}^2 \\sum_{y = 0}^3 \\sum_{z = 0}^4 (6 - z) \\\\\n&= 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{240}.\n\\end{align*}", "Solution:\nWe can start by picking $a$ and $d$.
