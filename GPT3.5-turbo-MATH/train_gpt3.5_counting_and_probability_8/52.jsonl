To find the largest $2$-digit prime factor of ${200\\choose 100}$, we need to find the largest $2$-digit prime factor of $200!$ that is not a factor of $100!$. We can do this by counting the number of factors of $2$ and $5$ in the prime factorization of $200!$ and $100!$.\n\nThe number of factors of $2$ in $200!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{2}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{2^2}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{2^3}\\right\\rfloor + \\dotsb = 100 + 50 + 25 + \\dotsb = 197$.

We note that $101$ is a prime number and is the largest prime number between $1$ and $200$. Since $101$ is prime and $100 < 101 < 200$, $101$ is a factor of $n$. We also note that $n$ is an integer, so $n$ has to be divisible by $101$.

Then $p$ divides every positive integer less than or equal to $200$ that is not divisible by $p$, but it divides every positive integer less than or equal to $100$ that is not divisible by $p$.  Therefore, $p$ divides the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $200$ that are not divisible by $p$ but does not divide the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that are not divisible by $p$.
