We can arrange the Venusian, Earthling, and Martian in $3$ ways (VEM, EMV, and MVE), so $|A_E \\cap A_M| = 3 \\cdot 13!$.\n\nTo compute $|A_M \\cap A_V \\cap A_E|$, we treat the Earthling, Martian, Venusian, and the person to their left as a single group. We then have $12$ people to seat, with no restrictions. There are $12!$ ways to do this. We can arrange the Earthling, Martian, and Venusian in $3$ ways, and the person to their left in $2$ ways, so $|A_M \\cap A_V \\cap A_E| = 6 \\cdot 12!$.\n\nBy PIE, we have \\begin{align*}\n|A| &= |A_M| + |A_V| + |A_E| \\\\\n&\\qquad - |A_M \\cap A_V| - |A_V \\cap A_E| - |A_E \\cap A_M| \\\\\n&\\qquad + |A_M \\cap A_V \\cap A_E| \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 14! + 2 \\cdot 13! + 2 \\cdot 14! \\\\\n&\\qquad - 3 \\cdot 13! - 3 \\cdot 13! - 3 \\cdot 13! \\\\\n&\\qquad + 6 \\cdot 12! \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 14! - 3 \\cdot 13! + 6 \\cdot 12!.\n\\end{align*}Hence, $N = \\frac{|A|}{(5!)^3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 14! - 3 \\cdot 13! + 6 \\cdot 12!}{(5!)^3} = \\boxed{256}$.", "There are $5$ choices for the Martian in chair $1$ and $5$ choices for the Earthling in chair $15$.  We consider the five committee members of each planet as a single group, so there are $3$ groups of $5$ that must be placed in the $12$ chairs between the Martian and Earthling.\n\nThere are $4$ choices for the Venusian to sit immediately to the right of the Martian (since the Earthling cannot sit immediately to the left of the Martian), and $3$ choices for the remaining Venusians.

Consequently, there are three possibilities: $1+49,$ $1+4+9+36,$ and $9+16+25.$ These correspond to the integers $17,$ $1236,$ and $345,$ respectively.

We try $d_1 = 7,$ which gives $50 - 49 = 1$ left over.  Trying $d_2 = 5,$ we are left with $1 - 25 = -24,$ which is impossible.  Trying $d_1 = 6,$ we get $50 - 36 = 14,$ so $d_2$ must be 3 or 4.
