Thus, the product of two integers is odd if and only if both of them leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\nThere are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17, inclusive, namely 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17.  The probability that the first integer chosen is odd is $\\frac{7}{13}$, and the probability that the second integer chosen is odd, given that the first integer chosen was odd, is $\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that both integers are odd is $\\frac{7}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{26}}$.", "Solution:\nThe only way the product of two integers is odd is if both integers are odd.  There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17, inclusive, so there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways to choose two distinct odd integers.
