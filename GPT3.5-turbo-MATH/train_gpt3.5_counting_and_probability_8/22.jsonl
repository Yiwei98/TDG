However, we can simplify the computation by noticing that $s_5$ is uniquely determined by $s_0$.  Specifically, we have \\[s_5 = \\frac{s_1+s_4}{2}.\\]Therefore, we can check the conditions for $s_0$ and $s_5$ only, and we can skip the computation of $s_1,s_2,s_3,$ and $s_4$.\n\nWe list the values of $s_5$ for $s_0$ between 10 and 99:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c}\n$s_0$ & $s_5$ & $s_0$ & $s_5$ \\\\ \\hline\n10 & 55 & 43 & 473 \\\\\n11 & 66 & 44 & 484 \\\\\n12 & 77 & 45 & 495 \\\\\n13 & 88 & 46 & 506 \\\\\n14 & 99 & 47 & 517 \\\\\n15 & 110 & 48 & 528 \\\\\n16 & 121 & 49 & 539 \\\\\n17 & 132 & 50 & 550 \\\\\n18 & 143 & 51 & 561 \\\\\n19 & 154 & 52 & 572 \\\\\n20 & 165 & 53 & 583 \\\\\n21 & 176 & 54 & 594 \\\\\n22 & 187 & 55 & 605 \\\\\n23 & 198 & 56 & 616 \\\\\n24 & 209 & 57 & 627 \\\\\n25 & 220 & 58 & 638 \\\\\n26 & 231 & 59 & 649 \\\\\n27 & 242 & 60 & 660 \\\\\n28 & 253 & 61 & 671 \\\\\n29 & 264 & 62 & 682 \\\\\n30 & 275 & 63 & 693 \\\\\n31 & 286 & 64 & 704 \\\\\n32 & 297 & 65 & 715 \\\\\n33 & 308 & 66 & 726 \\\\\n34 & 319 & 67 & 737 \\\\\n35 & 330 & 68 & 748 \\\\\n36 & 341 & 69 & 759 \\\\\n37 & 352 & 70 & 770 \\\\\n38 & 363 & 71 & 781 \\\\\n39 & 374 & 72 & 792 \\\\\n40 & 385 & 73 & 803 \\\\\n41 & 396 & 74 & 814 \\\\\n42 & 407 & 75 & 825\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe non-palindromes that take exactly six steps to become palindromes are 16, 18, 19, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 54, 58, 59, 63, 64, 68, 69, 74, and 78.

Reversing this sum gives $11(b+a)=11a+11b$, so the sum of $n$ and its reverse is always a multiple of 11. Thus, after one step, we have a number of the form $11x$, and after two steps, the number is of the form $11x+11y=11(x+y)$. Continuing this process, we see that the number after $k$ steps is of the form $11^kx+11^{k-1}y+\\cdots+11z$, where $0\\leq z<11$. Thus, in order for the number to become a palindrome after exactly six steps, it must be the case that $11^6x+11^5y+\\cdots+11z$ is a palindrome.\n\nSince the number is not a palindrome, the first digit is not equal to the last digit, so $z\\neq 0$. Since the number is a palindrome after six steps, we know that $11^6x+11^5y+\\cdots+11z$ is a palindrome, so $11z+11^2y+\\cdots+11^6x = 11(11^5x+11^4y+\\cdots+z)$ is a multiple of 121. Thus, $11^5x+11^4y+\\cdots+z$ must be a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 121.\n\nThe sum of the digits of a positive integer is congruent to the integer modulo 9, so $11^5x+11^4y+\\cdots+z$ is congruent to $x+y+z$ modulo 9. Thus, $x+y+z$ must be a multiple of 9, but not a multiple of 11. The two-digit numbers that satisfy this condition are 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, and 81. For example, if the number is $10a+b$, where $a>b$ and $a,b\\neq 0$, then we must have $a+b+2b+2a\\equiv 0\\pmod{9}$, which simplifies to $3a+3b\\equiv 0\\pmod{9}$. Since $a+b$ is not a multiple of 11, we must have $a\\neq b$, so either $a>b\\geq 1$ or $a>9>b=0$. In the first case, we have $a\\geq 2$ and $a+b<18$, so $3a+3b<57$. In the second case, we have $a\\geq 2$ and $a+b<11$, so $3a+3b<39$. Thus, $3a+3b$ can only be equal to 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, or 81.\n\nIf $x+y+z=9$, then the number is of the form $10a+10a-9=20a-9$.

If $x+y+z=45$, then the number is of the form $10a+10b+10c+10d+10e-(a+b+c+d+e)=9a+9b+9c+9d+9e$, where $a+b+c+d+e\\leq 9$. If $x+y+z=54$, then the number is of the form $10a+10b+10c+10d+10e+10f-(a+b+c+d+e+f)=9a+9b+9c+9d+9e+9f$, where $a+b+c+d+e+f\\leq 9$.

Since there are no negative probabilities, we conclude that the probability of forming a triangle is $\\boxed{0}$.", "Solution:\nFor three sticks to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sticks must be greater than the length of the longest stick.  We can use this fact to count the number of ways to choose three sticks that form a triangle.  There are $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose three sticks from the seven sticks.  We count the number of ways to choose three sticks that do not form a triangle.  The longest stick can be paired with any of the other six sticks, and this gives us six choices for the third stick.  The other two sticks must be chosen from the remaining five sticks, which can be done in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.  Therefore, there are $6\\cdot10=60$ ways to choose three sticks that do not form a triangle.  So, there are $35-60=-25$ ways to choose three sticks that form a triangle.  However, we must be careful, because we have overcounted the cases where the three sticks are all different.  There are $\\binom{7}{3}\\cdot3!=210$ ways to choose three sticks and arrange them in a line.  However, we have counted each valid set of sticks six times, since there are six ways to arrange any set of three sticks.  Therefore, the number of valid sets of sticks is $-25+210/6=10$.
