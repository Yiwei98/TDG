Thus, there are $2$ choices for each piece of fruit, so there are $2^5$ choices for the apples and $2^{10}$ choices for the oranges. However, we must subtract $1$ from each of these to account for the possibility that there are no apples or no oranges, so there are $2^5-1$ choices for the apples and $2^{10}-1$ choices for the oranges. Therefore, there are $(2^5-1)(2^{10}-1)$ choices for the fruit basket.

We have a total of $5+10=15$ pieces of fruit, which we need to place into baskets. We must have at least one piece of fruit in each basket, so we can start by putting one piece of fruit into each of the baskets, leaving us with $15-15=0$ pieces of fruit remaining. To distribute the remaining fruit, we can use 14 dividers (bars) to separate the remaining 0 pieces of fruit into 15 baskets.

{"question": "Problem:\nHow many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?", "answer": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.

If the balls were distinguishable, there would be $3^5$ ways of putting them in the boxes.  However, since the balls are not distinguishable, we have overcounted.

Therefore, we divide $3^5$ by 3 to get $3^4=\\boxed{81}$ as the number of ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls and boxes are indistinguishable.", "Solution:\nWe can use stars and bars to solve the problem.

We can represent the number of balls in each box as an ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ where $a+b+c=5$.  Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we can assume that $a\\ge b\\ge c$.  We can also assume that $a,b,c\\ge 0$ since it is possible to have an empty box.  Then, we can use stars and bars to determine the number of solutions.

We need to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes, which is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+x_3=5$ where $x_i$ is the number of balls in the $i$th box.

We can represent the balls as a string of 5 stars, like this:\n\n$$\\star \\ \\star \\ \\star \\ \\star \\ \\star$$\n\nWe can then place two dividers between the stars to represent the three boxes.
