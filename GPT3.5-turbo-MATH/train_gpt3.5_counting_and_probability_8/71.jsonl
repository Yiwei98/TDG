Indeed, suppose that $T = \\{t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{10}\\}$ does not satisfy the triangle property. Then, the largest element of $T$ is at least $t_1 + t_2 - 1$. Since $t_1 + t_2 \\le 3 + 4 + \\cdots + 12 = 78$, this implies that the largest element of $T$ is at least $78 - 1 = 77$. Since $S$ contains all integers up to $b$, this means that $T$ contains at least two elements greater than $77$. However, $76$ is the largest integer in $S$ that is not greater than $77$, so this is impossible. Thus, $T$ satisfies the triangle property.\n\nIt follows that $S$ must satisfy the triangle property. Indeed, if $S$ does not satisfy the triangle property, then we can find a ten-element subset $T$ of $S$ that does not satisfy the triangle property, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, we have shown that if $n$ is the smallest integer greater than the largest set $S$ of consecutive integers such that no three elements of $S$ satisfy the triangle inequality, then all ten-element subsets of $\\{4, 5, 6, \\ldots, n\\}$ satisfy the triangle property.
