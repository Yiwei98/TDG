{"question": "Problem:\nArnold is studying the prevalence of three health risk factors, denoted by A, B, and C, within a population of men. For each of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man in the population has only this risk factor (and none of the others) is 0.1. For any two of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man has exactly these two risk factors (but not the third) is 0.14. The probability that a randomly selected man has all three risk factors, given that he has A and B is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability that a man has none of the three risk factors given that he does not have risk factor A is $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.

We can choose the first half of the digits in $3^4$ ways.  (We have three choices for each of the four digits.)  The first digit cannot be 0.  If the first digit is 7, 8, or 9, then the last digit must be the same, so there is one palindrome for each of these three choices.
