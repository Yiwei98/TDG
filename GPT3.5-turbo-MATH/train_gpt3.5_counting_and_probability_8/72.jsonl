If the first two flips are $HT$ or $TH$, then the outcome ends in $3$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  Thus, $a_3 = 2 + 2 = 4$.  We can compute $a_4$ by thinking about the first three flips.  If they are $TTT$, then the outcome ends in $3$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  If the first three flips are $HTT$, $THT$, or $TTH$, then the outcome ends in $4$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  Thus, $a_4 = 1 + 3 = 4$.  We can compute $a_5$ by thinking about the first four flips.  If they are $TTTT$, then the outcome ends in $4$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  If the first four flips are $HTTT$, $THTT$, $TTHT$, or $TTTH$, then the outcome ends in $5$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  Thus, $a_5 = 1 + 4 = 5$.  Finally, we can compute $a_6$ by thinking about the first five flips.  If they are $TTTTT$, then the outcome ends in $5$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  If the first five flips are $HTTTT$, $THTTT$, $TTHTT$, $TTTHT$, or $TTTTH$, then the outcome ends in $6$ heads and no strings of $5$ consecutive heads.  Thus, $a_6 = 1 + 5 = 6$.  Any outcome with no strings of $5$ consecutive heads must end in one of these configurations, so the total number of outcomes with no strings of $5$ consecutive heads is $a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 20$.
