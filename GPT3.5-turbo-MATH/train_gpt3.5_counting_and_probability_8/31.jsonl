The integers between $2^k$ and $n+1$ that have exactly as many $1$'s as $0$'s are precisely those that have exactly $k$ digits, and so there are $\\binom{k}{0} + \\binom{k}{1} + \\dots + \\binom{k}{k/2 - 1}$ of these.  Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nf(n+1) &= f(n) + f(n+1 - 2^k) \\\\\n&= 2^n - \\binom{n}{0} - \\binom{n}{1} - \\dots - \\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\\\\n&\\quad + n+2 - 2^{k+1} - \\binom{k}{0} - \\binom{k}{1} - \\dots - \\binom{k}{k/2 - 1} \\\\\n&= 2^{n+1} - \\binom{n+1}{0} - \\binom{n+1}{1} - \\dots - \\binom{n+1}{\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the claim is proved.\n\nWe want to find $f(10) = 1024 - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\dots - \\binom{10}{5}.$  This is equal to $1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 - 120 - 210 - 252 = 386.$  Therefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{386}.$", "Solution:\nWe count the numbers with $k$ digits.
