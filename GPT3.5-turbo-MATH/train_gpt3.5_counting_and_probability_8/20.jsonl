One way to solve this is to consider the permutations of all 7 letters where the first four satisfy these conditions, and then divide to correct for overcounting. Once we have placed the L, we have 5 options for where to place the P--- any spot except the fourth one, which will become the last one when we remove the last three letters. We can then place the remaining 5 letters without restriction, which there are $5!$ ways to do. This gives us a preliminary count of $5\\times5!=600$. However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO. Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\\dfrac{5\\times5!}{6}=\\boxed{100}$.\n\nAlternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first.

We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string.\nHowever, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive. We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.\nFrom (1), we now have ${a+2\\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}$ orderings in total.\nHowever, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately.

This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place $2$ dividers among $9$ blue flags, which is $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ by stars and bars. We now have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: One pole has $7$ blue flags and the other has $3$ blue flags.\nIn this case, we must arrange $9$ green flags and $1$ blue flag on each pole such that no two green flags are adjacent. There are $4$ ways to place the blue flag on the pole with $3$ blue flags. We can think of arranging the green flags with stars and bars, with the blue flag as a divider. There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to arrange the green flags on the pole with $7$ blue flags, and $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to arrange the green flags on the pole with $3$ blue flags.
