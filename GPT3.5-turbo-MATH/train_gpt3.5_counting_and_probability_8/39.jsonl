{"question": "Problem:\nAssume we have a calendrical system in which leap years happen every four years, no matter what. In a 150-year period, what is the maximum possible number of leap years?", "answer": "Since 150 divided by 4 is 37.5, there are 37 blocks of 4 years in 150 years, plus two extra years.  If we let one of those two extra years be a leap year, and we have one leap year in each of the 37 blocks, then we have 38 leap years.  For example, we can choose a 150-year period that starts with a leap year. For example, 1904-2053 is a 150-year period with 38 leap years $(1904, 1908, \\ldots, 2052)$.  Now we check that under no circumstance will 39 work. We see the optimal situation would be if we start with a leap year and end with a leap year. Leap years happen every four years, so if we start with year $x$, $x$ being a leap year, the $38^{\\text{th}}$ leap year after $x$ is $x+4\\times38 = x+152$, so including $x$ there must be a total of 153 years, which is greater than 150. Therefore no 150-year period will contain 39 leap years. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{38}$.", "generated_answer": ["In a 150-year period, there are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{150}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 37$ leap years.

To maximize the number of leap years, we want to make as many of the years divisible by 100 as possible, but not divisible by 400.  The first such year is 200.  Therefore, we can have at most $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{150}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 1 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{150}{400} \\right\\rfloor = 37 - 1 + 0 = \\boxed{36}$ leap years.", "We can count the number of leap years in 4-year cycles.
